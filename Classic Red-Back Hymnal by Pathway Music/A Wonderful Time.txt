A wonderful time is just ahead,
The Lord whom we love and own
Will open the gates of glory-land,
Revealing His glory throne.

A wonderful time for you,
A wonderful time for me,
If we are prepared to meet Jesus the King,
A wonderful time ‘twill be.

A wonderful time is just ahead,
Our conflicts and trials passed;
Our wilderness journey at an end,
Safe home ev’ry one at last

A wonderful time is just ahead,
The groans of creation cease;
And all that is held in bondage now,
The Lord will that day release
