On Mount Olive’s sacred brow
Jesus spent the night in pray’r,
He's the pattern for us all, all alone,
If we’ll only steal away
In some portion of the day,
We will find it always pays to be alone.

There are times I’d like to be
All alone with Christ my Lord,
I can tell Him of my troubles all alone.

There are times I’d like to be
With the sanctified and blest,
There are times I like to be all alone,
God can always grace impart,
To my weary, saddened heart,
There are times I'd like to be just all alone

There are days to fast and pray
For the pilgrim in his way,
There are days to be with Christ all alone,
We can tell Him all our grief,
He will give us quick relief,
There are times I'd like to be just all alone

When a heart is broken up
With the tearful, lonesome cup,
Then’s the time to go to Christ all alone,
In our blessed Lord divine,
There is peace and joy sublime,
When we take our sorrows all to Him alone
