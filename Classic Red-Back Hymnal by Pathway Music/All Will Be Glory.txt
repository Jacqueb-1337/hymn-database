There's a day that is coming and it won't be very long,
Heaven and glory will be mine (will be mine);
Our Savior is coming, we soon shall hear the song,
All will be glory all the time.

Glory, glory all the time,
(All will be glory all the time, all the time,)
All is glory all the time;
(All will be glory all the time, all the time;)
Glory, glory, all is glory,
(All will be glory, all will be glory,)
All will be glory all the time(all the time.)

Blessed tho't fills my soul and I am happy all the day,
Loved ones awaiting I shall find (I shall find);
The lights growing brighter, they're shining all the way,
Soon 'twill be glory all the time

Blessed Savior is coming, we'll go home with Him to stay,
Like stars in glory we shall shine (we shall shine);
Forever and ever, at home beyond for aye,
Glory forever all the time
