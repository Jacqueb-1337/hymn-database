O, ye Christian soldiers, as you march along,
Be a light for Jesus every day;
Keep His banner hoisted all the whole day long
Be a light for Jesus every day.

Be a light, be a light,
Be a light for Jesus every day;
Be a light, be a light,
Be a light for Jesus every day.

Keep your lamps trimmed, burning so that all may see,
Be a light for Jesus every day;
Let the world see Jesus and from sin be free,
Be a light for Jesus every day

Thousands grope in darkness that can never see,
Be a light for Jesus every day;
Until we point them up to Mount Calvary,
Be a light for Jesus every day

Keep the light bright, shining all the world around,
Be a light for Jesus every day;
â€™Till, released from darkness, all the Lord have found,
Be a light for Jesus every day
