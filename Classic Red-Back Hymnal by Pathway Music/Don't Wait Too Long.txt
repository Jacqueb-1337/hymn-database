O soul, why stay away from Jesus,
Don't wait too long;
Decide today and come repenting,
O soul don't wait too long!

Don't wait too long!
Don't wait too long!
Decide today and come to Jesus,
O soul don't wait too long!

Today may be the last one given,
Don't wait too long;
Decide today for home and heaven,
O soul don't wait too long! 

While we in love for you are praying,
Don't wait too long;
Accept His Word and come obeying,
O soul don't wait too long!
