There's a happy land of promise over in the great beyond,
Where the saved of earth shall soon the glory share;
Where the souls of men shall enter and live on forever more,
Ev'rybody will be happy over there.

Ev'rybody will be happy (over there, over there)
will be happy over there,
We will shout and sing His praise (praises thru the never ending ages);
Ev'rybody will be happy over there.

Mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers will be singing 'round the throne,
In that land where no one ever knows a care;
And the Christians of all ages will join in the triumph song,
Ev'rybody will be happy over there

We will hear nobody praying and no mourning in that land,
For no burdens there will be for us to bear;
All the people will be singing "Glory, glory to the Lamb",
Ev'rybody will be happy over there

There we'll meet the One who saved us and who kept us by His grace,
And who bro't us to that land so bright and fair;
We will praise His name forever as we look upon His face,
Ev'rybody will be happy over there
