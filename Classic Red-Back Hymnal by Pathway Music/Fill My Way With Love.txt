Let me walk, blessed Lord, in the way Thou hast gone,
Leading straight to the land above;
Giving cheer ev’ry where, to the sad and the lone,
Fill my way ev’ry day with love.

Fill my way ev’ry day with love,
As I walk with the heav’nly Dove;
Let me go all the while, with a song and a smile,
Fill my way ev’ry day with love.

Keep me close to the side of my Saviour and Guide,
Let me never in darkness rove;
Keep my path free from wrath, and my soul satisfied,
Fill my way ev’ery day with love

Soon the race will be o’er, and I’ll travel no more,
But abide in my home above;
Let me sing, blessed King, all the way to the shore,
Fill my way ev’ry day with love
