Dread not the things that are ahead,
The burdens great, the sinking sands,
The thorns that o’er the path are spread,
God holds the future in His hands.

God holds the future in His hands,
And ev'ry heart He understands;
On Him depend; He is your Friend;
He holds the future in His hands.

We know not what tomorrow hides,
Of sun or storm, or good or ill;
We only know His dear hand guides
And He will be our Father still

His hand created earth and sky,
The zephyrs and the storms that rage,
And years to come and years gone by
To Him are but an open page

Live close to Him and trust His love,
Assured that while on earth we roam,
Whate’er may come, He bends above
To guide His children safely home
