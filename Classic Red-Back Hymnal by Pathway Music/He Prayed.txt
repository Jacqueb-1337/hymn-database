Jesus went upon the mountain that He might commune with God,
He prayed, He prayed,
On the hills of old Judea which my blessed Savior trod,
He prayed, He prayed.

He prayed, He prayed;
Jesus prayed unto the Father ev’ry day,
From the manger to the cross;
Not a moment’s time was lost,
Jesus prayed onto the Father all the way.

Out upon the rolling waters when the storm His vessel tossed,
He prayed, He prayed;
Then the winds and waves obeyed Him and He safely went across,
He prayed, He prayed

All alone while in the garden where He sweat great drops as blood,
He prayed, He prayed;
Not my will but Thine be done, my Father, was His pray’r to God,
He prayed, He prayed

When upon the cross of Calv’ry in His agony and pain,
He prayed, He prayed;
That the Father might forgive them whom the Son of God had slain,
He prayed, He prayed
