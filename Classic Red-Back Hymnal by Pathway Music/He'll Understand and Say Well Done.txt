If when you give the best of your service,
Telling the world that the Savior is come;
Be not dismayed when men don't believe you;
He'll understand; and say, "Well done."

Oh, when I come to the end of my journey,
Weary of life and the battle is won;
Carrying the staff and the cross of redemption,
He'll understand and say, "Well done."

Misunderstood, the Savior of sinners,
Hung on the cross; He was God's only Son;
Oh! hear Him call His Father in Heav'n,
"Not my will, but Thine be done." 

If when this life of labor is ended,
And the reward of the race you have run;
Oh! the sweet rest prepared for faithful
Will be His blest and final, "Well done." 

But if you try and fail in your trying,
Hands sore and scarred from the work you've begun;
Take up your cross, run quickly to meet Him;
He'll understand; and say, "Well done."
