If your burdens heavy grow,
Tell it to Jesus, He’ll understand;
All your sorrow He doth know,
Tell it to Jesus, He’ll understand.

Tell it to Jesus, He’ll understand,
Burdens will leave you at His command;
While you hold His guiding hand,
Tell it to Jesus, He’ll understand.

If you need a helper kind,
Tell it to Jesus, He’ll understand;
Better friend you’ll never find,
Tell it to Jesus, He’ll understand

When the tempter presses sore,
Tell it to Jesus, He’ll understand;
He has passed this way before,
Tell it to Jesus, He’ll understand

When you reach the Jordan tide,
Tell it to Jesus, He’ll understand;
He’ll be standing near your side,
Tell it to Jesus, He’ll understand
