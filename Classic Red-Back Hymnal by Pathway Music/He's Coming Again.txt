Our Savior will come once more upon this earth,
Exalted on high and not of lowly birth;
He’ll gather with Him all those who love His name,
He’s coming, yes, coming again.

He’s coming, I have so often heard,
He’s coming, ’tis written in His Word;
He’s coming, we’ll sing the glad refrain,
He’s coming, yes, coming again.

He’s coming again with angels shining bright,
In glory so fair from out the land of light;
Triumphant in pow’r, to earth He will descend,
He’s coming, yes, coming again

He’s coming again to judge the quick and dead,
The wicked shall flee before His face in dread;
The righteous will shout and praise His holy name,
He’s coming, yes, coming again

He’s coming again, we do not know the hour;
He told us to watch and pray to Him for pow’r;
That, come when He may, He’ll find us ready then,
And waiting His coming again
