Sometimes I feel discouraged, and think my life in vain,
I’m tempted then to murmur, and of my lot complain,
But when I think of Jesus, and all He’s done for me,
Then, I cry, O Rock of Ages,
Hide Thou Me.

O Rock of Ages,
Hide Thou Me,
No other Refuge, have I but Thee,
When life’s dark vale I wander,
Far, far from Thee;
Then I cry, O Rock of Ages,
Hide Thou me.

Sometimes it seems I dare not go one step farther on,
And from my heart all courage has slipped away and gone;
But, I remember Jesus, and all His love for me,
Then, I cry, O Rock of Ages,
Hide Thou Me

O what a Friend is Jesus, sure Anchor for my soul,
So tender, true and gracious, I’m safe in His control.
My help in time of danger, my strong defense is He,
O Thou blessed Rock of Ages,
Hide Thou Me
