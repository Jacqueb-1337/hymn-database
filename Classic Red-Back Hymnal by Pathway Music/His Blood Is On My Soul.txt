Dear Jesus all my sins forgave,
And washed and made me whole,
I have sweet peace and joy within,
His blood is on my soul.

His blood is on my soul,
His blood is on my soul,
I rest securely in His hand,
His blood is on my soul.

The tempter can not overcome,
Or gain the least control,
I have God’s everlasting seal,
Christ’s blood is on my soul

I have His Spirit now within,
My life in His control,
I’m ready for the crowning day,
His blood is on my soul

I am determined by His grace
To reach bright heaven’s goal,
And reign with Jesus on His throne,
His blood is on my soul
