The Savior now walks with me and sweetly He talks with me,
As upward to glory I go;
And daily I sing to Him and fondly I cling to Him,
Because I am loving Him so.
With mercy infolding me and power upholding me,
I never complain or repine;
No matter what may betide, assurance will still abide,
His love and His glory are mine,

His love forever is mine and with His glory I shine,
And so His goodness I tell and happy praises I swell;
As on to heaven I go, (Homeward I go,) rejoicing ever to know, (happy to know,)
His love and glory forever are mine(ever mine).

He's ever defending me, rich blessings is sending me,
While walking the heavenly way;
And nothing appalleth me, no evil befalleth me,
In safety I'm walking each day.
For never reproving me, but leading and loving me,
He causeth the home-path to shine;
And sweetly I'm praising Him, to sinners upraising Him,
His love and His glory are mine, 

Where endeth the story land begineth the glory land,
where ever with Him I shall be;
Thru Jesus all-glorious, forever victorious,
The life-crown is coming to me.
So daily I walk with Him and sweetly I talk with Him,
My blessed Redeemer divine;
And ever my song shall be His wonderful love for me,
His love and His glory are mine,
