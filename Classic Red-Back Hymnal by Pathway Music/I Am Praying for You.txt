I have a Savior, He’s pleading in glory,
A dear, loving Savior, though earth-friends be few;
And now He is watching in tenderness o’er me,
But O, that my Savior were your Savior, too!

For you I am praying,
For you I am praying,
For you I am praying,
I’m praying for you.

I have a Father; to me He has given
A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
And soon will He call me to meet Him in heaven,
But O, that He’d let me bring you with me, too! 

I have a robe, ’tis resplendent in whiteness,
Awaiting in glory my wondering view;
O, when I receive it all shining in brightness,
Dear friend, could I see you receiving one, too! 

When He has found you, tell others the story,
That my loving Savior is your Savior, too;
Then pray that your Savior may bring them to glory,
And prayer will be answered- ’twas answered for you!
