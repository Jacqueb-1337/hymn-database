I am so glad salvation’s free
to all who will receive it,
Glad that the news was brought to me
when I was lost and sad;
Praise His dear name, I can proclaim
that truly I believe it,
For I am now His child, I know,
and I’m so glad.

Glory, honor be to His name forever,
Never a greater friend the sinful race has had;
Love Him, praise Him, Jesus, the matchless Savior,
He has redeemed this soul of mine, and I’m so glad.

I am so glad that I can tell
to wayward souls the story,
Glad that by grace from day to day
a helper I may be;
Finding delight in service true,
my soul is winning glory,
Glory for Him who gave His life
to rescue me

I am so glad that all my heart
to Jesus I have given,
Glad that at eventide my soul
true sheaves to Him may bring;
I will be true until with all
the happy throng in Heaven,
Sweeter and nobler praise I give
to Christ, my king
