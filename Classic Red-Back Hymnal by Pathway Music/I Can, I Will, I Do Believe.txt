I'm kneeling at the mercy seat,
I'm kneeling at the mercy seat,
I'm kneeling at the mercy seat,
Where Jesus answers prayer.

I can, I will, I do believe,
I can, I will, I do believe,
I can, I will, I do believe,
That Jesus saves me now.

Refining fire, go thru my heart,
Refining fire, go thru my heart,
Refining fire, go thru my heart,
Illuminate my soul

O that it now from heav'n might fall,
O that it now from heav'n might fall,
O that it now from heav'n might fall,
And all my sins consume
