I have found the way
That leads to endless day,
Yonder in the glory-land;
And the road is bright,
For Jesus is the light,
And I hold His guiding hand.

I have found the way,
I have found the way,
Glory hallelujah,
I have found the way.

I will never fear,
While Jesus is so near,
I will bravely meet the foe;
Happy songs I’ll sing,
In honor to the King,
And to glory onward go

To the journey’s end,
Led by a faithful Friend,
Nevermore in sin to roam;
By the way called straight,
I’ll reach the golden gate
Of the soul’s eternal home
