I hear Your welcome voice
that calls me by Your will,
for cleansing in Your precious blood
that flowed on Calvary's hill.

I am coming, Lord,
coming by Your will:
wash me, cleanse me, by the blood
that flowed on Calvary's hill.

 ’Tis Jesus calls me on
to perfect faith and love,
to perfect hope, and peace, and trust,
for earth and heaven above

 ’Tis Jesus who confirms
the blessèd work within,
by adding grace to welcomed grace,
where reigned the power of sin

All hail, atoning blood!
All hail, redeeming grace!
All hail, the gift of Christ our Lord,
our strength and righteousness!
