I want to be a worker for the Lord,
I want to love and trust His holy word,
I want to sing and pray, and be busy ev'ry day,
In the vineyard of the Lord.

I will work, I will pray,
In the vineyard, in the vineyard of the Lord;
I will work, I will pray, I will labor ev'ry day,
In the vineyard of the Lord.

I want to be a worker ev'ry day,
I want to lead the erring in the way
That leads to heav'n above, where all is peace and love,
In the kingdom of the Lord

I want to be a worker strong and brave,
I want to trust in Jesus' pow'r to save,
All who will truly come shall find a happy home
In the kingdom of the Lord

I want to be a worker, help me, Lord,
To lead the lost and erring to Thy word
That points to joys on high, where pleasures never die,
In the kingdom of the Lord
