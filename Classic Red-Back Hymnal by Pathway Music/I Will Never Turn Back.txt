Once I wandered in darkness unsaved,
Till the Savior came knocking at my heart,
And I opened the door, let Him in,
Now rich blessings to me He imparts.

I will never turn back,
He’s my Light ev’ry day,
No I’ll never turn back,
For my Savior is leading the way.

Of His love I will sing ev’ry day,
Yes, I’ll sing of His wondrous pow’r to save,
For my Savior is leading the way,
To those mansions of glory above

In His service each day may I be,
Leading sinners to Jesus to be healed,
Thro’ the blood flowing from Calvary,
Till the light of His love is revealed

Healing body and soul by His blood,
And He keeps me each moment by His pow’r,
I will walk in the light of His Word,
And be ready to go any hour
