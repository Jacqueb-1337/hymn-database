I shall not bear the cross thro’ yon city
When the burdens of life are laid down.
When I knock on the portals of Heaven
I will trade the old cross for a crown.

Yes, I’ll trade the old cross for a crown,
When the burdens of life are laid down.
When the pearl gates for me shall swing open,
I will trade the old cross for a crown.

Tho’ the cross oftentimes has been heavy,
And oft fortune on me seems to frown,
But how happy I’ll be over yonder
When I trade the old cross for a crown

Oft, my bark has been tossed on life’s billows,
And each wave tries my vessel to drown.
But no storm cloud can harm me forever
When I trade the old cross for a crown

Ev’ry cross that I bear for my Savior
Will at last, when He calls, be laid down,
And my sorrows will all be forgotten
When I trade the old cross for a crown
