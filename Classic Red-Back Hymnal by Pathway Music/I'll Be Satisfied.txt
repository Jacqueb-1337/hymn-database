When my soul is singing in that promised land above,
I’ll be satisfied;
Praising Christ the Savior for redeeming grace and love,
I'll be satisfied.

I’ll be satisfied,
I’ll be satisfied;
When my soul is resting in the presence of the Lord,
I’ll be satisfied.

Living in a city where the soul shall never die,
I’ll be satisfied;
There to meet with loved ones, never more to say good-by,
I’ll be satisfied

When I meet the ransomed over on the golden shore,
I’ll be satisfied;
There I’ll join the angels singing praises evermore,
I’ll be satisfied
