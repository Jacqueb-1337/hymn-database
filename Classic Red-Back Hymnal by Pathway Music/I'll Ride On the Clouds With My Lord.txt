When I watch the clouds that rise, sweeping o'er the vaulted skies,
Then I think of that wonderful word,
Of His promise unto men that He's coming back again,
And I'll ride on the clouds with my Lord.

I'll ride on the clouds with my Lord,
I'll ride on the clouds with my Lord;
When He bids me arise,
And I start for the skies,
I'll ride on the clouds with my Lord.

When we tell the earth good-bye and shall rise up in the sky,
To meet Jesus whom we have adored;
How the chariots will run t'ward the bright unsetting sun,
When I ride on the clouds with my Lord

We shall drink with Him the wine gathered from the Father's vine,
When we feast round that bountiful board;
And the saints will all be there, dressed in garments all so fair;
When I ride on the clouds with my Lord

There we'll sing a glad new song with the happy blood-bo't throng,
On the gold harps we'll sound a new chord;
We'll forget all earthly tears in the bright eternal years,
When I ride on the clouds with my Lord
