When first I started to seek the Lord,
I’m glad I counted the cost;
I fully measured to Jesus’ word,
I’m glad I counted the cost.

I’ve paid the price and obtained the prize,
He saved my soul that was lost;
And now my treasures are in the skies,
I’m glad I counted the cost.

I laid my sorrows at Jesus’ feet,
I’m glad I counted the cost;
And now I’ve pleasures so pure and sweet,
I’m glad I counted the cost

I’ve bid farewell to this world of sin,
I’m glad I counted the cost;
And now my Jesus abides within,
I’m glad I counted the cost

Although the trials seem hard to bear,
I’m glad I counted the cost;
I now my burdens with Jesus share,
I’m glad I counted the cost

 ’Twill not be long till the Lord shall come,
I’m glad I counted the cost;
And bear my soul to that heav’nly home,
I’m glad I counted the cost
