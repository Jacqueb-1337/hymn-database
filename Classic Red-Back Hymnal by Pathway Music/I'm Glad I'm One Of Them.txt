There are people almost everywhere
Whose hearts are all aflame
With the fire that fell at Pentecost,
Which made them all acclaim;
It is burning now within my heart—
All glory to His name!—
And I’m glad that I can say I’m one of them.

One of them (one of them), one of them (one of them),
I am glad that I can say I’m one of them;
One of them (one of them), one of them (one of them),
I am glad that I can say I’m one of them.

Though the people may not learnèd be,
Nor boast of worldly fame,
They have all received their Pentecost,
Through faith in Jesus’ name;
And are telling now, both far and wide,
His power is yet the same,
And I’m glad that I can say I’m one of them

They were gathered in the upper room,
All praying in His name,
They were baptized in the Holy Ghost,
And power for service came;
Now what He did for them that day
He’ll do for you the same,
And I’m glad that I can say I’m one of them

Come, my brother seek this blessing
That will cleanse your heart from sin,
That will start the joy bells ringing
And will keep the soul aflame;
It is burning now within my heart—
All glory to His name!—
And I’m glad that I can say I’m one of them
