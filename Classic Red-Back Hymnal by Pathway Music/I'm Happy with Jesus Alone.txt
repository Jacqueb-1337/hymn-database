There's nothing so precious as Jesus to me;
Let earth with its treasures be gone;
I'm rich as can be when my Savior I see;
I'm happy with Jesus alone.

I'm happy with Jesus alone,
I'm happy with Jesus alone;
Though poor and deserted, thank God, I can say
I'm happy in Jesus alone.

When sinful and doomed to a life of despair,
No light on my pathway to shine,
'Twas Jesus who found me and made me an heir
To mansions of glory divine

When nothing but death for my ransom could pay,
And make me accepted with God,
'Twas Jesus who freely Himself made a prey
And ransomed my soul with His blood

 'Twas Jesus who called me and showed me the way
To peace upon earth and in heav'n;
'Tis Jesus who teaches me daily to pray
And walk in the light He has giv'n

Should father and mother forsake me below,
My bed upon earth be a stone,
I'll cling to my Savior who loves me, I know,
I'm happy with Jesus alone
A-men.
