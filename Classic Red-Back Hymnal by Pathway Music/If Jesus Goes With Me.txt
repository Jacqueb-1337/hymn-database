It may be in the valley,
Where countless dangers hide;
It may be in the sunshine
That I, in peace abide;
But this one thing I know-
If it be dark or fair,
If Jesus is with me,
I’ll go anywhere!

If Jesus goes with me, I’ll go.
Anywhere!
’Tis heaven to me,
Where’er I may be,
If He is there!
I count it a privilege here.
His cross to bear;
If Jesus goes with me, I’ll go-
Anywhere!

It may be I must carry
The blessed word of life
Across the burning deserts
To those in sinful strife;
And though it be my lot
To bear my colors there,
If Jesus goes with me,
I’ll go anywhere! 

But if it be my portion
To bear my cross at home,
While others bear their burdens
Beyond the billow’s foam,
I’ll prove my faith in Him-
Confess His judgments fair,
And, if He stays with me,
I’ll go anywhere! 

It is not mine to question
The judgments of my Lord,
It is but mine to follow
The leadings of His word;
But if to go or stay,
Or whether here or there,
I’ll be, with my Savior,
Content anywhere!
