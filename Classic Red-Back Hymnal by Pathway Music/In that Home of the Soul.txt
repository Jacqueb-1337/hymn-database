Soon the toils of life will cease,
Then no sorrow we shall know,
In that home of the soul;
There we’ll dwell in joy and peace,
Robed in garments as snow,
In that home of the soul.

Blessed thought, there to dwell,
In that home of the soul;
Endless praise we shall swell,
In that home of the soul.

There the Saviour we shall see,
And His glory ever share,
In that home of the soul;
Reunited we shall be,
With the ransomed over there,
In that home of the soul

While the ages onward roll,
Round the shining throne we’ll sing,
In that home of the soul;
With the angels we’ll extol,
Him, the Christ, our Lord, and King,
In that home of the soul
