In the great triumphant morning,
When we hear the Bridegroom cry,
And the dead in Christ shall rise,
We’ll be changed to life immortal,
In the twinkling of an eye,
And meet Jesus in the skies.

We shall all rise to meet Him,
We shall all rise to greet Him,
In the morning when the dead in Christ shall rise
We shall all rise to meet Him,
We shall all rise to greet Him,
And shall have the marriage supper in the skies.

In the great triumphant morning,
What a happy time ’twill be,
When the dead in Christ shall rise,
When the Lord descends in glory,
Sets His waiting children free,
And we meet Him in the skies

In the great triumphant morning,
When the harvest is complete,
And the dead in Christ shall rise,
We’ll be crowned with life immortal,
Christ and all the loved ones meet,
In the rapture in the skies

In the great triumphant morning,
All the kingdom we’ll possess,
Then the dead in Christ shall rise,
Reign as kings and priests eternal,
Under Christ forever blest,
After meeting in the skies
