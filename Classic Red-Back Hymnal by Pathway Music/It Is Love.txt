There is something in my soul
Which keeps the shadows all away;
It is love, my Savior’s love!
Something lightens every burden,
Gives me gladness day by day,
It is love, my Savior’s love.

O the precious love of Jesus,
How it thrills my ransomed soul!
More and more I’ll sing its praises
While the happy ages roll.

When the tempter tries to win me
Something keeps me true and strong;
It is love, my Savior’s love!
Something makes my life a blessing
To the needy in the throng,
It is love, my Savior’s love

When misfortune overtakes me
Something calms my troubled breast;
It is love, my Savior’s love!
Something draws my soul to heaven,
That sweet land of peace and rest.
It is love, my Savior’s love

Soul astray and bowed in sorrow,
Something waits for you today;
It is love, my Savior’s love!
It would give you peace and comfort,
Make your burdens roll away,
It is love, my Savior’s love
