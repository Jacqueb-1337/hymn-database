Is there a heart that is waiting,
Longing for pardon today?
Hear the glad message proclaiming
Jesus is passing this way.
Is there a heart that has wandered?
Come with thy burden today;
Mercy is tenderly pleading,
Jesus is passing this way.

Jesus is looking for thee,
Jesus is looking for thee,
Sweet is the message today,
Jesus is looking for thee.

Is there a heart that is broken,
Weary and sighing for rest?
Come to the Saviour who offers
Peace to the sad and oppressed.
Come to thy only redeemer,
Come to his infinite love,
Come to the gate that is leading
Homeward to mansions above.
