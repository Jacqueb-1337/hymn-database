Come, hear me tell the story Paul and Silas loved so well,
How Jesus left His home above and came on earth to dwell.
You ask me why He suffered? I can only say “I know
He gave His life a ransom, just because He loved me so.”

He loved me so, He loved me so,
He gave His life a ransom,
Just because He loved me so.
He loved me so, He loved me so,
He gave His life a ransom,
just because He loved me so.

I’m glad my dear Redeemer walked beside the Galilee;
His life was pure and holy, and His grace was full and free.
He calls for me to follow, I will walk with Him below;
He will never, never leave me, just because He loves me so

I will sing His boundless mercy, all the beauty of His ways;
If at times I do not see Him, I will trust and give Him praise.
No matter where He leads me, it is best for me, I know;
I will lean upon His promise, just because He loved me so
