There are many paths through this world of sin,
But there’s only one I shall travel in;
’Tis the old Cross Road, or the way called “Straight”—
There is just one way to the pearly gate.

There is just one way to the pearly gate,
To the crown of life and the friends who wait;
’Tis the old Cross Road, or the way called “Straight”—
There is just one way to the pearly gate.

There are some who sneer at the old Cross Road,
At the pearly gate and the soul’s abode;
Yet I mind them not, but, with happy song
And assurance sweet, still I press along

Others risk their souls on some new-made way,
Thinking they will come to the gate some day;
Oh, may they find out, ere their lives are done,
That the old Cross Road is the only one.
