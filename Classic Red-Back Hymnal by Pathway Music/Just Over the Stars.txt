There is a land of pure delight,
Where trouble never mars;
But joy and peace forever reign,
’Tis the land just over the stars.

Just over the stars,
Just over the stars,
The blood washed throng
Will sing Sweet home,
In that land just over the stars.
Just over the stars,
Just over the stars,
We soon shall stand with that angel band,
In that land just over the stars.

Our Savior there at last we’ll meet,
When we shall cross the bars;
He’ll bid us welcome home up there,
In that land just over the stars

We’ll sing and shout with that glad throng,
When safe from Satan’s wars;
And praise our Savior evermore,
In that land just over the stars
