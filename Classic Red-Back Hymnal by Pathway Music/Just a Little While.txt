Soon this life will all be over
And our pilgrimage will end,
Soon we’ll take our heav’nly journey,
Be at home again with friends;
Heaven’s gates are standing open,
Waiting for our entrance there,
Some sweet day we’re going over,
All the beauties there to share.

Just a little while to stay here,
Just a little while to wait,
Just a little while to labor
In the path that’s always straight,
Just a little more of troubles,
In this low and sinful state,
Then we’ll enter Heaven’s portals,
Sweeping through the pearly gates.

Soon we’ll see the light of morning
Then the new day will begin,
Soon we’ll hear the Father calling,
“Come my children enter in;”
Then we’ll hear a choir of angels,
Singing out the vict’ry song,
All our troubles will be ended
And we’ll live with heaven’s throng

Soon we’ll meet again our loved ones
And we’ll take them by the hand,
Soon we’ll press them to our bosom
Over in the promised land;
Then we’ll be at home forever,
Throughout all eternity,
What a blessed, blessed morning
That eternal morn will be!
