In Thy field I would wield sickles brave and true,
In the fight for the right I would dare and do,
Spend my days in Thy praise all the journey thru,
Let me live close to Thee each day.

Let me live close to Thee,
Take my hand, dear Lord, and guide me all along the rugged way;
O let me live close to Thee,
Let me walk close to Thee each day.

Not the crown nor renown that the world might see,
I would work, never shirk, blessed Lord, for Thee,
But to know where I go that my soul is free,
Let me live close to Thee each day

Help me bear and to share some poor pilgrim’s load,
Be my friend to the end of the toilsome road,
I would sing to my King in the soul’s abode,
Let me live close to Thee each day
