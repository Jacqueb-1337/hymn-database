When sorrow and storms are besetting my track,
And Satan is whisp’ring, “You’d better turn back,”
How oft I have proved it, tho’ dark be the way,
A little believing drives clouds all away.

Lord, I believe, Lord, I believe!
Savior, raise my faith in Thee,
Till it can move a mountain;
Lord, I believe, Lord, I believe!
All my doubts are buried in the fountain.

How easy when sailing the sea in a calm,
To trust in the strength of Jehovah’s great arm;
But somehow I find when the waves swamp the boat,
It takes some believing to keep things afloat

 “I’ll stand to the end,” I have heard people say,
“I’ll fight till I die, and will ne’er run away;”
But when by temptation so fiercely assailed,
They left off believing, and terribly failed

And others there are full of courage and zeal,
Who go to the battle like warriors of steel;
But right in the heat of the conflict with sin,
Instead of believing they faint and give in

Then let us remember in running this race,
That faith is not feeling, and trust is not trace;
And when around us seems dark as the night,
We’ll keep on believing, and win in the fight
