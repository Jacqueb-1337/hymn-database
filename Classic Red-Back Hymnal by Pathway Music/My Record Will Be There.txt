In a day that is not far,
At the blazing judgment bar,
Even now the awful summons I can hear;
I must meet the mighty God,
I must face His holy Word,
I must stand before the judgment bar.

Oh, my record will be there,
Be its pages dark or fair,
When I stand before the judgment bar;
When the books shall open lie,
In that morning by and by,
Oh, my record, oh, my record will be there.

I must meet each broken vow,
That I hold so lightly now,
Ev'ry heartache I have caused, each sigh, each tear;
Things that time cannot erase,
I must meet them face to face,
When I stand before the judgment bar

Ev'ry secret lust and tho't
There shall be to judgment bro't,
When the Lord in all His glory shall appear;
All the deeds of darkest night
Shall come out to greet the light,
When I stand before the judgment bar

I must meet my cankered gold,
For whose greed my life was sold,
It shall mock me in the judgment’s lurid glare;
Saying ye have sold for naught,
All the Savior’s blood has bo't,
You must stand before the judgment bar

Let me turn and seek the Lord,
Let me trust His holy Word,
Let me bow and call upon Him while He’s near;
Then when I my record face,
He will answer in my place
When I stand before the judgment bar
