I’ll wear a crown of glory
When I get home,
I’ll sing the wondrous story
When I get home.
The Savior there will greet me,
He’ll be the first to meet me,
And by His side will seat me,
When I get home.

When I get home,
When I get home,
I’ll sing the wondrous story
When I get home.
When I get home,
When I get home,
I’ll sing the wondrous story
When I get home.

And darkness will be ended
When I get home,
But light and love be blended
When I get home.
I’ll never know a sorrow,
When comes that glorious morrow,
But joyful songs forever,
When I get home

There’ll be no time for weeping
When I get home,
But be a blessed reaping
When I get home.
For Jesus there will bless me,
And lovingly caress me,
And nothing will distress me,
When I get home
