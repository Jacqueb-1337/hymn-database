I'm going along, o'erflowing with song,
The sin-clouds all rolled away [rolled away];
The heavenly Dove is bending above,
To cheer me from day to day.

All glory to Him I bring! [ever bring!]
With gladness to Him I cling[singing glory,]
With perfect delight, by day and by night
this wonderful song I sing.

He's guiding me straight to fair heaven's gate,
And making my pathway clear [ever clear];
He's leading me on to heaven's fair throne,
With angels to dwell up there

With love-light aglow, wherever I go,
I'll sing of His saving grace [saving grace];
When earth-life is o'er, then, forevermore,
I'll look on His smiling face
