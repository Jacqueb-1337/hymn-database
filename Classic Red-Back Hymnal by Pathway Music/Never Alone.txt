I’ve seen the lightning flashing
And heard the thunder roll,
I’ve felt sin’s breakers dashing,
which tried to conquer my soul;
I’ve heard the voice of my Savior,
He bid me still fight on:
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

No, never alone,
No, never alone;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone:
No, never alone,
No, never alone:
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

The world’s fierce winds are blowing–
Temptation’s sharp and keen;
I have a peace in knowing
My Savior stands between;
He stands to shield me from danger
When all my friends are gone:
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone

When in affliction’s valley
I tread the road of care,
My Savior helps me carry
My cross so heavy to bear;
Though all around me is darkness
And earthly joys are flown,
My Savior whispers His promise:
Never to leave me alone

He died on Calv'ry's mountain,
For me they pierced His side,
For me He opened that fountain,
The crimson, cleansing tide;
For me He’s waiting in glory
Upon His heavenly throne:
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone
