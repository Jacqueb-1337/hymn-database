Come soul and find thy rest,
No longer be distress'd;
Come to thy Saviour's breast,
O don't stay away.

Pray'rs are ascending now,
Angels are bending now;
Both worlds are blending now,
O don't stay away.

Dark is the world and cold,
Her cares cannot be told;
Come to thy Saviour's fold,
O don't stay away 

Come with thy load of sin,
Christ died thy soul to win;
Now He will take thee in,
O don't stay away 

Time here will soon be past,
Moments are flying fast;
Judgment will come at last,
O don't stay away 

Come, O we pray thee, come,
Come and no longer roam;
Come now and start for home,
O don't stay away
