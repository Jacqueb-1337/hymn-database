O ransomed souls, with joyous song
Press along to Glory land;
Extolling grace that saves the race,
Press along to Glory land.

Press along, glad soul, press along,
Giving out the message grand;
Letting love, God’s love, be your song,
Press along to Glory land.

The foe may rave, but Christ will save,
Press along to Glory land;
The storm may sweep, but He will keep,
Press along to Glory land

To join once more those gone before,
Press along to Glory land;
With saints to sing before the King,
Press along to Glory land

The crown to wear forever there,
Press along to Glory land;
To sing His praise thro’ countless days,
Press along to Glory land
