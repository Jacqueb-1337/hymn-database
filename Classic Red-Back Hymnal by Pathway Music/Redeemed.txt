Sweet is the song I am singing today:
I’m redeemed! I’m redeemed!
Trouble and sorrow have vanished away:
I have been redeemed!

I’m redeemed by love divine!
Glory, glory! Christ is mine, Christ is mine!
All to Him I now resign, resign
I have been redeemed, redeemed!

Happiness thrills me as onward I go:
I’m redeemed! I’m redeemed!
All the way homeward my praises shall flow:
I have been redeemed! 

Oh, what a wonderful Savior is He;
I’m redeemed! I’m redeemed!
His evermore I am sure I shall be:
I have been redeemed!
