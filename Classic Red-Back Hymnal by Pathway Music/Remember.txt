I remember how my Saviour died for me,
On the rugged cross of dark Mount Calvary;
I remembered how He cried,
How He bowed His head and died,
I remember dark Calvary.

I remember how He paid the debt for me,
How His blood was shed on dark Calvary.
O the blood of Calvaryâ€™s brow,
I can see it flowing now,
I remember dark Calvary.

I remember how He blessed and broke the bread,
Signifies my broken body, thus He said;
Broken on the cruel tree,
Hanging there for you and me;
I remember dark Calvary

I remember how He blessed the cup of wine,
That which is the precious fruitage of the vine;
O this is my blood, He said,
And for many it was shed;
I remember dark Calvary
