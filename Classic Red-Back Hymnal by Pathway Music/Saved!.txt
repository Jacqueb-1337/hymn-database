I've found a friend who is all to me,
His love is ever true;
I love to tell how He lifted me,
And what His grace can do for you.

Saved by His pow'r, by His pow'r divine,
Saved to new life, to new life sublime!
Life now is sweet and my joy is complete,
For I'm saved, saved, saved.

He saves me from ev'ry sin and harm,
Secures my soul each day;
I'm leaning strong on His mighty armâ€“
I know He'll guide me all the way

When poor and needy and all alone,
In love He said to me,
"Come unto Me and I'll lead you home
To live with Me eternally."
