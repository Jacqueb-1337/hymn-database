O blessed tho’t sweet rest will come,
Some glad day after while;
When all our earthly toil is done,
There’ll come a glad day after while.

O after while, after while
There’ll come a glad day after while,
There’ll come a glad day after while.

These heavy burdens we’ll lay down,
Some glad day after while;
When we receive our heav’nly crown,
There’ll come a glad day after while

Our suff’ring too will all be past,
Some glad day after while;
When we shall find sweet rest at last,
There’ll come a glad day after while

All war and strife will soon be o’er,
Some glad day after while;
We’ll find sweet peace on heaven’s shore,
There’ll come a glad day after while
