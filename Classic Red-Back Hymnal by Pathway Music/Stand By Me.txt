When the storms of life are raging,
stand by me; (stand by me)
when the storms of life are raging,
stand by me(stand by me)
When the world is tossing me
like a ship upon the sea,
thou who rulest wind and water,
stand by me(stand by me)

In the midst of tribulation,
stand by me; (stand by me)
in the midst of tribulation,
stand by me(stand by me)
When the hosts of hell assail,
and my strength begins to fail,
thou who never lost a battle,
stand by me(stand by me)

In the midst of faults and failures,
stand by me; (stand by me)
in the midst of faults and failures,
stand by me(stand by me)
When I’ve done the best I can,
and my friends misunderstand,
thou who knowest all about me,
stand by me(stand by me)

In the midst of persecution,
stand by me; (stand by me)
in the midst of persecution,
stand by me(stand by me)
When my foes in war array
undertake to stop my way,
thou who rescued Paul and Silas,
stand by me(stand by me)

When I’m growing old and feeble,
stand by me; (stand by me)
when I’m growing old and feeble,
stand by me(stand by me)
When my life becomes a burden,
and I’m nearing chilly Jordan,
O thou Lily of the Valley,
stand by me(stand by me)
