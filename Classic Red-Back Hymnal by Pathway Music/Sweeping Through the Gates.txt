I am now a child of God,
I’ve been washed in Jesus’ blood,
I am watching and I’m longing
While I wait;
Soon on wings of love I’ll fly,
To a home beyond the sky;
To my welcome,
As I’m sweeping thro’ the gates.

Sweeping thro’ the gates,
Sweeping thro’ the gates,
In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb,
Washed from every stain I am;
Hallelujah!
I am sweeping thro’ the gates.

Oh, the blessèd Lord of light
Now upholds me by His might,
And His arms enfold and comfort
While I wait;
I am leaning on His breast;
Oh, the sweetness of this rest!
Hallelujah!
I am sweeping thro’ the gates

I am sweeping thro’ the gate,
Where the blessèd for me wait,
Where the weary workers
Rest forevermore.
Where the strife of earth is done,
And the crown of life is won,
Oh, the glory of that city just before! 

Burst are all my prison bars,
And I soar beyond the stars,
To my Father’s house,
The bright and blest estate;
Lo! the morn eternal breaks,
And the song immortal wakes,
Washed in Jesus’ blood,
I’m sweeping thro’ the gates
