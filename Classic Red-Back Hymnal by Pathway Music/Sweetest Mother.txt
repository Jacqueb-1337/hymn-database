She’s a little old fashioned,
That sweet mother of mine,
There are many whose beauty
Will my mother’s outshine;
She’s a little old fashioned,
As I plainly can see,
But she is for ever;
Sweetest mother to me.

She’s a little old fashioned,
But she’s sweeter each day,
I adore her plain features,
And her thin locks of gray,
There’s a glory around her,
God abides it may be
And she is for ever
Sweetest mother to me.

She’s a little old fashioned,
That sweet mother of mine,
Though even her plainness
Now my heart-strings entwine,
Other hands may be whiter,
But none other so dear,
For they smoothed my pillow,
For many a year

She’s a little old fashioned,
She stays closely at home,
So calm and contented,
Although others may roam,
And in tender young childhood,
‘Twas that home sheltered me,
And she who so graced it,
Dearest ever shall be
