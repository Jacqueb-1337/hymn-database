Christ is making sinners free,
Full salvation giving,
Whosoever will may come,
None He will refuse;
Therefore, that the lost may know,
And with Christ believing,
All the way, every day,
Tell and sing the news.

Tell it, sing it, let the breezes wing it,
Helping sinners Christ the Lord to choose;
Tell it, sing it, let your joy-bells ring it,
O’er and o’er, evermore,
Tell and sing the news.

All transgressions from the past
He is freely hiding,
And is giving songs of joy
To the sad and lone;
Millions in His presence now
Safely are abiding;
Tell it out, sing it out,
Make His mercy known

All may have eternal life,
If they will believe Him;
All may wear the robe and crown
In the world above;
He will surely richly bless
All who will receive Him;
Shout the news, preach the news,
Praise His mighty love
