I’m in the way, the bright and shining way,
I’m in the glory-land way;
Telling the world that Jesus saves today,
Yes, I’m in the glory-land way.

I’m in the glory-land way;
I’m in the glory-land way;
Heaven is nearer, and the way groweth clearer,
For I’m in the glory-land way.

List to the call, the gospel call today,
Get in the glory-land way;
Wand’rers, come home, oh, hasten to obey,
And get in the glory-land way

Onward I go, rejoicing in His love
I’m in the glory-land way;
Soon I shall see Him in that home above,
Oh, I’m in the glory-land way
