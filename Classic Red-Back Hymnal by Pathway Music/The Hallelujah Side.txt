Once a sinner far from Jesus,
I was perishing with cold,
But the blessèd Savior heard me when I cried;
Then He threw His robe around me,
And He led me to His fold,
And I’m living on the hallelujah side.

Oh, glory be to Jesus, let the hallelujahs roll;
Help me ring the Savior’s praises far and wide,
For I’ve opened up tow’rd heaven
All the windows of my soul,
And I’m living on the hallelujah side.

Tho’ the world may sweep around me
With her dazzle and her dreams,
Yet I envy not her vanities and pride,
For my soul looks up to heaven,
Where the golden sunlight gleams,
And I’m living on the hallelujah side

Not for all earth’s golden millions
Would I leave this precious place,
Tho’ the tempter to persuade me oft has tried,
For I’m safe in God’s pavilion,
Happy in His love and grace,
And I’m living on the hallelujah side

Here the sun is always shining,
Here the sky is always bright;
’Tis no place for gloomy Christians to abide,
For my soul is filled with music
And my heart with great delight,
And I’m living on the hallelujah side

And upon the streets of glory,
When we reach the other shore,
And have safely crossed the Jordan’s rolling tide,
You will find me shouting Glory
Just outside my mansion door
Where I’m living on the hallelujah side
