I was once in Egypt’s bondage,
But deliverance came to me,
And I’m living now in Canaan,
For the Son hath made me free.

I am dwelling now in Canaan,
Jesus’ blood avails for me;
I am free from condemnation,
For the Son hath made me free.

I was once a slave to Satan,
And he worked his will in me,
But I’m bound by sin no longer,
For the Son hath made me free

Ere I entered into Canaan,
Inbred sin remained in me;
But from it I’ve found a cleansing,
For the Son hath made me free

All my fear, all condemnation,
All that stood ’twixt God and me,
Praise His name! are left behind me
For the Son hath made me free
