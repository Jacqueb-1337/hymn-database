My heart belongs to Jesus now, and I'm walking in the light
His loving arms encircle me, and my path is always bright;
I travel onward singing praise, ever standing for the right,
For my heart belongs to Jesus forevermore.

I'm His, He's mine,
We are truly one at last
(praise God,) I'm His, He's (truly) mine,
And He hides my sinful past;
My heart belongs to Jesus now,
And my sinful days are o'er,
And His happy praise my soul shall raise forevermore.

He found me bending under sin, and He took away my load,
He held my hand and led me straight to the happy gospel road;
And now I'm going on with Him to the soul's divine abode,
For my heart belongs to Jesus forevermore

Some happy day at heaven's gate my Redeemer I shall see,
And with a smile and words of love, I am sure He'll welcome me;
Then in His love my soul shall rest thru the glad eternity,
For my heart belongs to Jesus forevermore
