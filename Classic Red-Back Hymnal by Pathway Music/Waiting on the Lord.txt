Waiting on the Lord, for the promise given;
Waiting on the Lord to send from heaven:
Waiting on the Lord, by our faith receiving;
Waiting in the upper room.

The power! the power!
Gives vict’ry over sin, and purity within;
The power! the power!
The pow’r they had at Pentecost.

Waiting on the Lord, giving all to Jesus;
Waiting on the Lord, till from sin He frees us;
Waiting on the Lord for the heav’nly breezes:
Waiting in the upper room

Waiting on the Lord, longing to mount higher;
Waiting on the Lord, having great desire;
Waiting on the Lord for the heav’nly fire;
Waiting in the upper room
