There’s a blessed time that’s coming, coming soon, coming soon,
It may be evening, morning or at noon,
The wedding of the bride, united with the Groom,
We shall see the King when He comes.

We shall see the King, We shall see the King,
We shall see the King when He comes;
He is coming in pow’r, we’ll hail the blessèd hour,
We shall see the King when he comes.

Are you ready should the Savior call today?
Would Jesus say, Well done or Go away?
My home is for the pure, the vile can never stay,
We shall see the King when He comes

Oh, my brother, are you ready for the call?
To crown your Savior king and Lord of all?
The kingdoms of this world shall soon before Him fall,
We shall see the King when He comes
