What a wonderful feeling,
Just to know He is mine,
To Him humbly I'm kneeling,
He is a friend divine.

What a wonderful feeling to know He is mine,
Just to be a joint heir with Him brings glory divine;
Ev'ry hour I would serve Him, all to Him consign,
What a wonderful feeling to know He is mine.

O what wonderful glory,
Walking with Him each day,
I am singing the story,
Happy along the way

Shadows vanish before me,
I can see His true light,
Wings are hovering o'er me,
Making the pathway bright
