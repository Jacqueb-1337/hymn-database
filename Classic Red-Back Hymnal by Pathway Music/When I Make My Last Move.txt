I've been trav'ling for Jesus so much of my life,
I've been trav'ling on land and on sea,
But I'm counting on taking a trip to the sky,
That will be the last move for me.

When I move to the sky,
Up to Heaven on High,
What a wonderful trip that will be!
I'm all ready to go,
Washed in Calvary's flow;
That will be the last move for me.

I've seen wonderful sights as I've trav'led afar,
But how little how empty 'twill seem,
When I make my last move to that City of Gold,
And behold what no vision could dream

Ther'll be prophets of yore, whom I'll meet over there,
And whose teachings have guided me right,
I shall meet the Apostles and Jesus my Lord
I believe I shall know them at sight

Here I'm bothered with packing each time that I move,
And I carry a load in each hand,
But I'll not need one thing
I have used in this world
When I move to that Heavenly land

Ev'rything that I need will be furnished up there,
And not even my song books I'll bring,
And the precious old Bible that showed me the way
I'll not need when I stand by the King

Here I'm constantly saying farewell to my friends,
And the partings bring heartaches and pain,
But when moving day comes when I make my last trip
We shall meet where we'll part ne'er again
