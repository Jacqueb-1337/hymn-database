When I reach my home eternal,
Reach that city bright and fair,
When I stand among the angels,
Will my mother know me there?

Yes, I know that she will know me,
In those mansions bright and fair;
Mother’s love can ne’er forget me,
And I’m sure shell know me there.

I have changed with changing seasons,
I am bent with toil and care,
Do you think she will remember,
Will my mother know me there? 

Oft for me my mother wrestled,
When she used to kneel in pray’r,
Do you think that she’ll forget me,
Will my mother know me there? 

Mother’s face has been a beacon,
O’er a sea of deep despair,
I shall look for her up yonder,
Will my mother know me there?
