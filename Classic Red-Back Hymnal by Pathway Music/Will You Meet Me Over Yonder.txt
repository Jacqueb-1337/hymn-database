I am bound for that bright city
Where the streets are paved with gold,
Where in peace I’ll dwell forever,
O the joy can ne’er be told.

Will you meet me over yonder,
And with happy millions dwell?
Will you meet me over yonder,
Where we’ll never say farewell.

That will be a happy meeting
With the dear ones passed away;
O the joy of that reunion
In that land of endless day

Brother, say how are you living?
Should He call for you to go,
Are you ready for the summons?
Is your robe made white as snow? 

There a mansion is awaiting
For the ones who overcome;
Soon life’s storms will pass forever,
And we’ll safely reach our home
