There is wonder-working pow’r in the precious blood,
There is pow’r in the blood;
It will cleanse from ev’ry sin,
It will make you pure within,
There is pow’r in the blood.

Wonderful pow’r in the blood,
There is perfect cleansing pow’r in the precious blood;
Wonderful pow’r in the blood,
There is wonder-working pow’r in the blood.

Praise the Father and the Son for the sacrifice;
There is pow’r in the blood;
That was made for you and me,
That from sin we might be free,
There is pow’r in the blood

When we at the judgment stand blood will be our plea;
There is pow’r in the blood;
There’s no other way I know,
But this precious crimson flow,
There is pow’r in the blood

O our Savior’s precious blood flowed for all the world;
There is pow’r in the blood;
‘Tis salvation’s wondrous plan,
That was made for ev’ry man,
There is pow’r in the blood

Whosoever will may come to this precious blood;
There is pow’r in the blood;
Sinner, do not longer wait,
For the judgment seals thy fate,
There is pow’r in the blood
