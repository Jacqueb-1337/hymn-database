Oh, why should I be lost?
So careless meet my doom?
I hear a loving voice,
Inviting me to come.

Yes, whosoever will,
May freely come to God:
’Tis mercy calling still,
Come, sinner, to the blood.

The Spirit and the bride,
And angels round the throne,
Assure me Jesus died,
That I may freely come

I know that God is love,
He freely gave His Son,
Who intercedes above,
That I may truly come

I hear the strong appeal
From my Redeemer’s throne,
And in my heart I feel
That even I may come

Yes, whosoever will,
Thy word, O Lord, I own;
Tho' near the brink of hell,
All heaven bids me come
