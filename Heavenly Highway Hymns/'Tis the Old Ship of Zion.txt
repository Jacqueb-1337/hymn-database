'Tis the ol' ship of Zion,
'Tis the ol' ship of Zion,
'Tis the ol' ship of Zion;
Get on board, get on board!

It has landed many a thousand,
It has landed many a thousand,
It has landed many a thousand;
Get on board, get on board!

King Jesus is the captain,
King Jesus is the captain,
King Jesus is the captain;
Get on board, get on board!

Hum...
