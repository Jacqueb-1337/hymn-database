I want to be a soul winner for Jesus ev'ry day,
He does so much for me;
I want to aid the lost sinner to leave his erring way,
And be from bondage free.

A soul winner for Jesus, A soul winner for Jesus,
O let me be each day; A soul winner for Jesus,
A soul winner for Jesus,
He's done so much for me.

I want to be a soul winner and bring the lost to Christ,
That they His grace may know;
I want to live for Christ ever, and do His blessed will,
Because He loves me so

I want to be a soul winner till Jesus calls for me,
To lay my burdens down;
I want to hear Him say, servant, "You've gathered many sheaves,
Receive a shining crown."
