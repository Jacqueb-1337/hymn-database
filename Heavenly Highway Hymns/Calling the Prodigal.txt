God is calling the prodigal, come without delay,
Hear, O hear Him calling, calling now for thee;
Tho’ you’ve wandered so far from His presence, come today,
Hear His loving voice calling still.

Calling now for thee, O weary prodigal, come;
Calling now for thee, O weary prodigal, come.

Patient, loving and tenderly still the Father pleads,
Hear, O hear Him calling, calling now for thee;
Oh! return while the Spirit in mercy intercedes,
Hear His loving voice calling still

Come, there’s bread in the house of thy Father, and to spare,
Hear, O hear Him calling, calling now for thee;
Lo! the table is spread and the feast is waiting there,
Hear His loving voice calling still
