: (sing first refrain twice)
Ev'rybody ought to know,
Ev'rybody ought to know,
Ev'rybody ought to know Who Jesus is.

He's the Lily of the Valley,
He's the Bright and Morning Star;
He's the fairest of ten thousand,
Ev'rybody ought to know

On the cross He died for sinners,
And His blood makes white as snow;
Loving, living, coming Saviorâ€”
He's the one you ought to know
