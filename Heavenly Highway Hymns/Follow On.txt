My soul o'erflows with joy and peace,
Where Jesus shows His face,
And bids all doubt and sorrows cease,
And saves me by His grace!

O will you follow on?
O will you follow on?
O will you follow where He leads?
O will you follow on?

Thro' shadows deep, he lights the way,
And leads my soul along,
To mansions fair and endless day,
The land of praise and song

When to death's narrow stream I come,
Tho' dark the wave and cold,
My Lord doth call my spirit home,
Into His peaceful fold

All glory to His precious name,
Who gave His life for me;
His grace, His goodness I'll proclaim,
Thro' all eternity
