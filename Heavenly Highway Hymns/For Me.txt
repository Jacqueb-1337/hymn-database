For me (the Lord prayed,)
He prayed (for relief)
For me (for me) for me, (for me;)
Alone (His heart broke,) alone (He bore grief)
For me (for me) for me (for me.)

Glory to God He's coming again,
coming from heav'n for me;
He intercedes in heaven for me,
King of all kings is He.

For me (He was slain,)
He died (on the cross)
For me (for me) for me, (for me;)
I shame (between thieves,) in shame (and deep loss)
For me (for me) for me (for me.) 

For me (dead in sin,)
He rose (from the grave)
For me (for me) for me, (for me;)
With pow'r (subdued death,) with pow'r (me to save)
For me (for me) for me (for me.)
