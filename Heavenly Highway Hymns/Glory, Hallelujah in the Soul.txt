When I came to Christ, I was all defiled,
Now there’s glory hallelujah in my soul;
Since I saw the blood and was reconciled,
There’s a glory hallelujah in my soul.

There is glory,
There is glory,
There’s a glory hallelujah in my soul,
There is glory,
There is glory,
There’s a glory hallelujah in my soul.

Yes, I came to Christ with my load of sin,
There’s a glory hallelujah in my soul,
And I plead and knock’d till He let me in,
There’s a glory hallelujah in my soul

Come, O wanderer, come and go with me,
There’s a glory hallelujah in my soul;
come and see what Christ’s blood will do for thee,
There’s a glory hallelujah in my soul

I will honor Christ wheresoe’er I go,
There’s a glory hallelujah in my soul;
His blood has wash’d me as white as snow,
There’s a glory hallelujah in my soul

When I leave the earth I will say good-by,
There’s a glory hallelujah in my soul;
I will soar towards heav’n, far above the sky,
There’s a glory hallelujah in my soul
