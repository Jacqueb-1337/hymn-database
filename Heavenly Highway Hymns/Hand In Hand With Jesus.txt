Once from my poor sin-sick soul
Christ did ev'ry burden roll,
Now I walk redeemed and whole,
Hand in hand with Jesus.

Hand in hand we walk each day,
Hand in hand along the way;
Walking thus I cannot stray,
Hand in hand with Jesus.

In my night of dark despair,
Jesus heard and answered prayer,
Now Iâ€™m walking free as air,
Hand in hand with Jesus

From the strait and narrow way,
Praise the Lord, I cannot stray,
For I'm walking ev'ry day,
Hand in hand with Jesus

When the stars are backward rolled,
And His Home I shall behold,
I will walk those streets of gold,
Hand in hand with Jesus
