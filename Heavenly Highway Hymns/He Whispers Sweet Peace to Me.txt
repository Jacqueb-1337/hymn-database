Sometime when misgivings darken the day,
And faith's light I cannot see;
I ask my dear Lord to brighten the way,
He whispers sweet peace to me.

He whispers sweet peace to me,
He whispers sweet peace to me,
And thro'His blest word He strengthens my soul,
He whispers sweet peace to me.

I could not go on without Him I know,
The world would o'erwhelm my soul;
His word is a lamp and brightens the way,
It points to the heav'nly goal

I trust Him thru faith, by faith hold His hand,
By faith I will travel on;
I'll trust in His word, obey His commands,
'Till vict'ry I shall have won[Rerain]

He speaks thru His word, assurance He gives,
I'm His and I know He's mind;
And safe in the fold my soul he will keep,
I'll rest in His love divine
