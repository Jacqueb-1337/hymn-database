O would you be numbered as one of His fold?
Be spotless within;
Be watching and waiting that sight to behold,
He’s coming again!

He’s coming again!
He’s coming again!
Be watching and waiting that sight to behold;
He’s coming again!

Not known is the moment when He shall appear,
To gather them in;
The souls who have followed Him faithfully here;
He’s coming again! 

The voice of His Spirit says, ready, then be,
O will you begin?
If peace in His presence you hope then to see;
He’s coming again! 

Risk not, an acceptance of Him in that day,
All covered with sin,
Be robed and all ready, the Spirit doth say,
He’s coming again!
