I was lost in sin, but Jesus rescued me,
He's a wonderful Savior to me;
I was bound by fear, but Jesus set me free,
He's a wonderful Savior to me.

For He's a wonderful Savior to me,
He's a wonderful Savior to me;
I was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in:
He's a wonderful Savior to me.

He's a Friend so true, so patient and so kind,
He's a wonderful Savior to me;
Ev'rything I need in Him I always find,
He's a wonderful Savior to me

He is always near to comfort and to cheer,
He's a wonderful Savior to me;
He forgives my sins, He dries my ev'ry tear,
He's a wonderful Savior to me

Dearer grows the love of Jesus day by day,
He's a wonderful Savior to me;
Sweeter is His grace while pressing on my way,
He's a wonderful Savior to me
