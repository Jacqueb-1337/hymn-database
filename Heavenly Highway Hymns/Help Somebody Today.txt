Look all around you, find someone in need,
Help somebody today!
Tho' it be little--a neighborly deed--
Help somebody today!

Help somebody today,
Somebody along lifeâ€™s way;
Let sorrow be ended, the friendless befriended,
Oh, help somebody today!

Many are 'waiting a kind, loving word,
Help somebody today!
You have a message, O let it be heard,
Help somebody today! (Chorus)

Many have burdens too heavy to bear,
Help somebody today!
Grief is the portion of some everywhere,
Help somebody today! (Chorus)

Some are discouraged and weary in heart,
Help somebody today!
Someone the journey to heaven should start,
Help somebody today! (Chorus)
