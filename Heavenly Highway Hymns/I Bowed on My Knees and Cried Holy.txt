I dreamed of a city called glory, so bright and so fair,
When I entered the gates I cried holy, the angels all met me there.
They carried me from mansion to mansion, Oh, the sights I saw.
Then I said I want to see Jesus,
The One who died for me.
I bowed on my knees and cried holy, holy, holy,
I clapped my hands and sang glory, glory to the Son of God.

Then as I entered the gates of that city, my loved ones all knew me well,
They took me down the streets of heaven, on the scenes too many to tell.
I saw Abraham, Jacob and Isaac; talked with Mark and Timothy.
But I said I want to see Jesus,
The One who died for me.
I bowed on my knees and cried holy, holy, holy,
I clapped my hands and sang glory, glory to the Son of God.
