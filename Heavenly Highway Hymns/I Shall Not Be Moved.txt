Glory hallelujah, I shall not be moved;
Anchored in Jehovah, I shall not be moved,
Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.
I shall not be, I shall not be moved,
I shall not be, I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

In His love abiding, I shall not be moved;
And in Him confiding, I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.
I shall not be, I shall not be moved,
I shall not be, I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Tho' all hell assail me, I shall not be moved;
Jesus will not fail me, I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.
I shall not be, I shall not be moved,
I shall not be, I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.

Tho' the tempest rages, I shall not be moved,
On the Rock of Ages, I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.
I shall not be, I shall not be moved,
I shall not be, I shall not be moved;
Just like a tree that's planted by the waters,
I shall not be moved.
