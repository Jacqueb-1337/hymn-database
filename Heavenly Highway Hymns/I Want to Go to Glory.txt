When I am thro’ with toil and care,
I want to go to glory some day;
That land of love so bright and fair,
I want to go to glory some day.

I want to go to glory some day,
My blessed Lord has promised I may;
That home so fair that waits just over there;
I want to go to glory some day.

Tho’ I a pilgrim now may roam,
I want to go to glory some day;
This earth I know is not my home,
I want to go to glory some day

When I shall leave life’s weary road,
I want to go to glory some day;
When I at last lay down my load,
I want to go to glory some day

No tears will there e’er dim the eye,
I want to go to glory some day;
There friends will never say “Goodby”
I want to go to glory some day

Because my Savior lives on high,
I want to go to glory some day;
To help to crown Him by and by,
I want to go to glory some day
