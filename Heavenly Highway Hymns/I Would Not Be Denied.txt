When pangs of death seized on my soul,
Unto the Lord I cried,
Till Jesus came and made me whole,
I would not be denied.

I would not be denied,
I would not be denied,
Till Jesus came and made me whole,
I would not be denied.

As Jacob in the days of old,
I wrestled with the Lord;
And instantly with a courage bold,
I stood upon His Word

Old Satan said my Lord was gone
And would not hear my pray'r,
But praise the Lord the work is done,
And Christ the Lord is here
