’Tis a sweet and glorious thought that comes to me:
I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on;
Jesus saved my soul from death and now I’m free:
I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on.

I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on,
Through eternity I’ll live on;
I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on,
Through eternity I’ll live on.

When my body’s slumbering in the cold, cold clay,
I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on;
There to sleep in Jesus till the judgment day:
I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on

When the world’s on fire, and darkness veils the sun,
I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on;
Men will cry and to the rocks and mountains run:
I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on

In the glory-land with Jesus on the throne,
I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on;
Through eternal ages singing home, sweet home;
I’ll live on, yes, I’ll live on
