I've found the Saviour, and I'm happy now in Him,
I'm on the sunny side of life:
He gives me vict'ry, I have peace and joy within,
I'm on the sunny side of life.

I'm on the sunny side, I'm on the sunny side,
I'm on the sunny side of life;
I'm on the sunny side, I'm on the sunny side,
I'm on the sunny side of life.

I've left the wilderness, I'm on the other side,
I'm on the sunny side of life:
Till Jesus calls me home, in Canaan I'll abide,
I'm on the sunny side of life

The passing days bring many cares for me, I know,
I'm on the sunny side of life:
I praise the Lord, He keeps me whiter than the snow,
I'm on the sunny side of life

Brother, so weary, hear the Saviour calling thee,
Come on the sunny side of life:
He will deliver, He will keep thee ev'ry day,
Come on the sunny side of life
