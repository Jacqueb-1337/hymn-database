'Mid the toil and strife of this busy life,
Is it well with your soul?
Are you living right, should you die to-night?
Is it well with your soul?

Is it well with your soul,
Are you free, glad and whole?
Are you living right, should you die to-night?
Is it well with your soul?

Have you lost your sin, are you pure within?
Is it well with your soul?
Are you at the side of the crucified?
Is it well with your soul? 

Do you praise the love of the One above?
Is it well with your soul?
Will the crown be won and the Lord's "well done?"
Is it well with your soul?
