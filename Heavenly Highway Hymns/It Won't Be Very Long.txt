It won't be very long till this short life shall end,
It won't be very long till Jesus shall descend;
And then the dead in Christ from beds of clay shall rise
To meeet the Lord and King up yonder in the skies.

It won't be very long,
It won't be very long
Till Jesus shall appear,
That day is drawing near;
Will you be ready then
To meet the ransomed throng?
Get ready for that day,
It won't be very long.

It won't be very long till here we cease to roam,
It won't be very long till all the saints get home;
And then with smiling face we'll walk the streets ofgold,
And sing the Savior's praise where saints are never old

It won't be very long till burdens we lay down,
It won't be very long till we'll receive a crown;
And then we'll should  and sing with angels round the throne,
And when we meet up there, we'll know as we are known

It won't be very long till earth shall pass away,
It won't be very long till works of men decay;
But Jesus has prepared a happy dwelling place,
For all who look above and trust His matchless grave
