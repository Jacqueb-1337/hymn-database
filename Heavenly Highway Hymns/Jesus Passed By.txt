There is a story of long ago,
Men roamed in darkness no where to go;
One day the scene changed, they ceased to cry,
There was a reason, Jesus passed by.

Glory and honor be to the King,
Shout hallelujah, make praises ring;
Lok to the future home in the sky,
There is a reason, Jesus passed by.

Men found compassion, hungry were fed,
Some saw their loved ones bro't from the dead;
They found grat comfort came from on high,
There was a reason, Jesus passed by

One day a sinner, I found relief,
Gone was my burden, gone was my grief;
Angels were singing, and so was I,
There was a reason, Jesus passed by
