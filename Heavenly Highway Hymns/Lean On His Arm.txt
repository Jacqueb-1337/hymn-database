Lean on the mighty arm of Jesus,
Hide in the hollow of His hand;
'Neath His protecting wings abide you,
Firm on the Rock of Ages stand.

Lean on His arm,
Hide in the hollow of His hand!
Lean on His arm,
Firm on the Rock of Ages stand.

Lean on the mighty arm of Jesus,
Wait you not for the morning dawn;
Ev'night of life may come and find you,
And with your strength and courage gone

Lean on the mighty arm of Jesus,
For 'tis the only refuge sure;
Let not another's invitation,
Now from this hope, your soul allure

Lean on the mighty arm of Jesus,
And of His boundless mercy share;
Drink of the ever living fountain,
Down by the Rock of Ages there
