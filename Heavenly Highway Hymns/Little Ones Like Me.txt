Jesus, when He left the sky,
And for sinners came to die,
In His mercy passed not by
Little ones like me.

 

Little ones, little ones,
Little ones like me;
In His mercy passed not by
Little ones like me.

Mothers then the Savior sought
In the places where He taught,
And to Him their children brought—
Little ones like me.

 

Little ones, little ones,
Little ones like me;
And to Him their children brought—
Little ones like me.

Did the Savior say them nay?
No! He kindly bade them stay,
Suffered none to turn away
Little ones like me.

 

Little ones, little ones,
Little ones like me;
Suffered none to turn away
Little ones like me.

 ’Twas for them His life He gave,
To redeem them from the grave;
Jesus now will gladly save
Little ones like me.

 

Little ones, little ones,
Little ones like me;
Jesus now will gladly save
Little ones like me.
