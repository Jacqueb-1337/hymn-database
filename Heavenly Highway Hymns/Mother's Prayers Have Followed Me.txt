I grieved my Lord from day to day,
I scorned His love so full and free,
And though I wandered far away,
My mother’s pray'rs have followed me.

I’m coming home, I’m coming home,
To live my wasted life anew,
For mother’s pray'rs have followed me,
Have followed me the whole world thro'.

O’er desert wild, o’er mountain high,
A wanderer I chose to be,
A wretched soul condemned to die,
Still mother’s pray'rs have followed me

He turned my darkness into light,
This blessed Christ of Calvary,
I’ll praise His Name both day and night,
That mother’s pray'rs have followed me[Refran]
