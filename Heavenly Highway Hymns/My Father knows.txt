He knows the bitter, weary way,
The endless striving day by day,
The souls that weep, the souls that pray—
He knows it all,
He knows it all, He knows it all,
The souls that weep, the souls that pray—
He knows it all.

He knows how hard the fight has been,
The clouds that come our lives between,
The worlds the world has never seen—
He knows it all,
He knows it all, He knows it all,
The worlds the world has never seen—
He knows it all.

He knows, when faint and worn we sink,
How deep the pain, how near the brink
Of dark despair we pause and shrink—
He knows it all,
He knows it all, He knows it all,
Of dark despair we pause and shrink—
He knows it all.

He knows! O tho’t so full of bliss!
For tho’ on earth our joys we miss,
We still can bear it, feeling this—
He knows it all,
He knows it all, He knows it all,
We still can bear it, feeling this—
He knows it all.
