There are some things I may not know,
There are some places I can't go,
But I am sure of this one thing
That God is real for I can feel Him deep within.

Yes, God is real, real in my soul,
Yes, God is real for He has washed and made me whole;
His love for me is like pure gold,
Yes, God is real for I can feel Him in my soul.

Some folks may doubt, some folks may scorn,
All can desert and leave me alone,
But as for me I'll take God's part
For God is real and I can feel Him in my heart

I cannot tell just how you felt
When Jesus took your sins away,
But since that day, yes, since that hour
God has been real for I can feel His holy pow'r
