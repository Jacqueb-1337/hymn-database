Christ went a building to prepare,
Not made with hands,
And ‘twill be decked with jewels rare,
Not made with hands.

I know, I know, I have another building,
Yes, I know, I know,
Not made with hands.

Just look over yonder and what do I see?
Not made with hands,
A heavenly home prepared for me,
Not made with hands

I’ve never been to heaven but so I’m told,
Not made with hands,
That the heavenly streets are paved with gold,
Not made with hands

The angels’ wings all tipped with gold,
Not made with hands,
They are so glorious to behold,
Not made with hands

Some morning fair I’m going away,
Not made with hands,
And I won’t come back ‘till Millennial day;
Not made with hands

I have some friends who’ve gone before,
Not made with hands,
Up there we’ll meet to part no more,
Not made with hands
