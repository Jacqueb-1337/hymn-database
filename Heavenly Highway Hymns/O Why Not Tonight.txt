O do not let the word depart,
And close thine eyes against the light;
Poor sinner, harden not your heart;
Be saved, O tonight.

O why not tonight?
O why not tonight?
Wilt thou be saved?
Then why not tonight?

Tomorrowâ€™s sun may never rise
To bless thy long deluded sight;
This is the time, O then be wise,
Be saved, O tonight

Our Lord in pity lingers still,
And wilt thou thus His love requite?
Renounce at once thy stubborn will,
Be saved, O tonight

Our blessed Lord refused none
Who would to Him their souls unite;
Believe, obey, the work is done;
Be saved, O tonight
