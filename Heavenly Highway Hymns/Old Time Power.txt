They were in an upper chamber,
They were all with one accord,
When the Holy Ghost descended,
As was promised by the Lord.

O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
O Lord, send the pow'r just now,
And baptize ev'ry one.

Yes, this pow'r from heavâ€™n descended,
With the sound of rushing wind;
Tongues of fire came down upon them,
As the Lord said He would send

Yes, this "old-time" pow'r was given
To our fathers who were true;
This is promised to believers,
And we all may have it too
