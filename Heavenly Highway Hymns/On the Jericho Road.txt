As you travel along on the Jericho road,
Does the world seem all wrong and heavy your load?
Just bring it to Christ, your sins all confess,
On the Jericho road your heart He will bless.

On the Jericho road there’s room for just two,
No more and no less, just Jesus and you;
Each burden He’ll bear, each sorrow He’ll share,
There’s never a care for Jesus is there.

On the Jericho road blind Bartimaeus sat,
His life was a voice, so empty and flat;
But Jesus appeared, one word bro’t him sight,
On the Jericho road Christ banished his night

O brother to you this message I bring,
Tho hope may be gone, He’ll cause you to sing;
At Jesus’ command, sin’s shackles must fall,
On the Jericho road will you answer His call?
