If I should be living when Jesus comes,
And could know the day and the hour,
I’d like to be standing at mother’s tomb
When Jesus comes in His power.

’Twill be a wonderful, happy day,
Up there on the golden strand,
When I can hear Jesus my Savior say,
Shake hands with mother again.

I’d like to say, Mother, this is your boy,
You left when you went away;
And now, my dear mother, it gives me great joy
To see you again today

There’s coming a time when I can go home
To meet my loved ones up there;
There I can see Jesus upon His throne
In that bright city so fair

There’ll be no more sorrow or pain to bear
In that home beyond the sky;
A glorious thought when we all get there,
We never will say, goodbye]
