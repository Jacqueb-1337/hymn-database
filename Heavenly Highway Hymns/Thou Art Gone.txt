Thou art gone, our precious darling,
Never more canst thou return;
Thou shalt sleep a peaceful slumber,
Till the resurrection morn.

We shall meet to part, no, never,
By and by, By and by;
We shall meet to part, no, never,
In that home beyond the sky.

Then beyond this vale of sorrow
We’ll awake from ev’ry care;
In a city bright, eternal,
And its joys we’ll ever share

Thou art gone, our precious darling,
Never more we’ll see thy face;
Till we meet thee o’er the river,
In that happy dwelling place

There we’ll meet you, precious darling,
There we’ll clasp glad hands once more;
When we’ve met, to part, no, never,
On that happy, peaceful shore

There we’ll spend the countless ages,
Ever by our Saviour’s side;
There we’ll never know a sorrow,
There our tears will all be dried
