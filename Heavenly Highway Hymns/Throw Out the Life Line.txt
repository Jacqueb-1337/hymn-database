Throw out the lifeline across the dark wave;
There is a brother whom someone should save;
Somebody’s brother, O who then will dare
To throw out the lifeline, his peril to share?

Throw out the lifeline! Throw out the lifeline!
Someone is drifting away;
Throw out the lifeline! Throw out the lifeline!
Someone is sinking today.

Throw out the lifeline with hand quick and strong;
Why do you tarry, why linger so long?
See, he is sinking, O hasten today;
And out with the lifeboat, away, then, away! 

Throw out the lifeline to danger-fraught men,
Sinking in anguish where you’ve never been;
Winds of temptation and billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow

Soon will the season of rescue be o’er;
Soon will they drift to eternity’s shore;
Haste then, my brother, no time for delay!
But throw out the lifeline and save them today
