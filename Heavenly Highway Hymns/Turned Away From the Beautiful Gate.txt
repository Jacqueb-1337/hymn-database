Someone will knock at the saints’ bright home,
And hear the Lord saying, “You cannot come;”
With sadness he’ll mourn o’er his sorrowful state,
Turned away from the beautiful gate.

Turned away from the beautiful gate,
Turned away from the beautiful gate,
With sadness he’ll mourn o’er his sorrowful state,
Turned away from the beautiful gate.

Someone will hear the angels’ song,
And wish he could join with the happy throng;
With sighing he’ll mourn o’er his sorrowful state,
Turned away from the beautiful gate

Someone will stand with an aching heart,
While Jesus pronounces the word “depart;”
With groanings he’ll mourn o’er his sorrowful state,
Turned away from the beautiful gate

Someone will linger with tearful eyes,
While Christ and his people ascend the skies,;
With weeping he’ll mourn o’er his sorrowful state,
Turned away from the beautiful gate

Someone will go into darkness drear,
Far off from the Saviour and all that’s dear;
With anguish he’ll mourn o’er his sorrowful state,
Turned away from the beautiful gate
