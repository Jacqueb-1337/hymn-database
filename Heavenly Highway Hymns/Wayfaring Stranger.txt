I’m just a poor wayfaring stranger
while journeying through this Land of woe
But there's no sickness toil or danger
In that bright world to which I go.

I’m going there to see my Mother/Father,
she said she'd/he said he'd meet me when I would come.
I’m just a-going over Jordan
I’m just a-going over home.

I know dark clouds will gather o’er me,
I know my way lies rough and steep
But Beauteous Fields lie out before me
Where God's redeemed their vigils keep
