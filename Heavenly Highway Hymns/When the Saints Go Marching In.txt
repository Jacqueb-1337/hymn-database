Iâ€™m just a weary pilgrim,
Plodding thru this world of sin;
Getting ready for that city
When the saints go marching in.

When the saints go marching in,
When the saints go marching in;
Lord I want to be in that number
When the saints go marching in.

My father loved the Savior,
What a soldier he had been!
But his steps will be more steady
When the saints go marching in

And mother, may God bless her,
I can see her now, as then;
With a robe of white around her
When the saints go marching in

Up there I'll see the Savior
Who redeemed my soul from sin,
With extended hands He'll greet me
When the saints go marching in
