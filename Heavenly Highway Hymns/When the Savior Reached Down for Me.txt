Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way,
And was wretched and vile as could be;
But my Saviour above, gave me peace, joy and love,
When He reach’d down His hand for me.

When He reached down His hand for me,
When He reach’d down His hand for me;
I was lost and undone, without God or His Son,
When He reached down His hand for me.

I was nearing despair, when He came to me there,
And he showed me that I could be free;
Then He lifted my feet, gave me glory complete,
When He reach’d down His hand for me

How my heart doth rejoice since I made Him my choice,
From the tempest to Him now I flee;
Now I lean on His arm, I’m secure from all harm,
Since He reach’d down His hand for me

Since the Lord gave me peace heav’nly joys never cease,
Lord, I give all my life unto Thee;
Guide my feet, hold my hand, grant with Thee I may stand,
For you reach’d down your hand for me
