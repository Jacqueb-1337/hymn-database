Living below in this old sinful world,
Hardly a comfort can afford;
Striving alone to face temptation sore,
Where could I go but to the Lord?

Where could I go? Oh, where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul?
Needing a friend to save me in the end,
Where could I go but to the Lord?

Neighbors are kind, I love them ev’ry one,
We get along in sweet accord;
But when my soul needs manna from above,
Where could I go but to the Lord? 

Life here is grand with friends I love so dear,
Comfort I get from God’s own word;
Yet when I face the chilling hand of death,
Where could I go but to the Lord?
