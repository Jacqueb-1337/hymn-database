Where is my wand’ring boy tonight,
The boy of my tend’rest care,
The boy that was once my joy and light,
The child of my love and pray’r?

O where is my boy tonight?
O where is my boy tonight?
My heart o’erflows, for I love him, he knows;
O where is my boy tonight?

Once he was pure as morning dew,
As he knelt at his mother’s knee;
No face was as bright, no heart more true,
And none was so sweet as he

O, could I see you now, my boy,
As fair as in olden time,
When prattle and smile made home a joy,
And life was a merry chime! 

Go for my wand’ring boy tonight;
Go search for him where you will;
But bring him to me with all his blight,
And tell him I love him still
