To Canaan’s land I’m on my way,
Where the soul never dies;
My darkest night will turn to day,
Where the soul never dies.

No sad farewells,
No tear-dimmed eyes;
Where all is love,
And the soul never dies.

A rose is blooming there for me,
Where the soul never dies;
And I will spend eternity,
Where the soul never dies

A love light beams across the foam,
Where the soul never dies;
It shines to light the shores of home,
Where the soul never dies

My life will end in deathless sleep,
Where the soul never dies;
And everlasting joys I’ll reap,
Where the soul of man never dies

I’m on my way to that fair land,
Where the soul of man never dies;
Where there will be no parting hand,
Where the soul never dies
