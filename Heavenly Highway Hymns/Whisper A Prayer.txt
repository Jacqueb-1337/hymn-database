Whisper a pray’er in the morning,
Whisper a pray’r at noon;
Whisper a pray’r in the ev’ning,
To keep your heart in tune.

God answers pray’r in the morning,
God answers pray’r at noon;
God answers pray’r in the ev’ning,
To keep your heart in tune.

Jesus may come in the morning,
Jesus may come at noon;
Jesus may come in the ev’ning,
So keep your heart in tune.
