Over the river, shining forever,
There is a city, I know,
Wonderful story! mansions of glory
Waiting for pilgrims below.

Wonderful city; beautiful city,
Built without hands by our King;
Marvelous city, glorious city,
Where we forever shall sing.

Home of the sages, saints of all ages,
martyrs and angels of light;
Free of all sadness, city of gladness,
Always so peaceful and bright! 

Hasten tomorrow, end of all sorrow,
When this glad home I shall see;
When with my Savior, happy forever,
Resting above I shall be
