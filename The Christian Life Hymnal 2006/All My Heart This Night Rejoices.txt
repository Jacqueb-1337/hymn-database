All my heart this night rejoices,
As I hear,
Far and near,
Sweetest angel voices;
"Christ is born," their choirs are singing,
Till the air
Ev'rywhere
Now with joy is ringing.

For it dawns, the promised morrow
Of his birth,
Who the Earth
Rescues from its sorrow.
God in human form descending;
Of his grace
To our race
Here his Son is lending.

Come then, let us hasten yonder;
Here let all,
Great and small,
Kneel in awe and wonder.
Love Him who with love is yearning;
Hail the Star
That from far
Bright with hope is burning!

You who pine in weary sadness,
Weep no more,
For the door
Now is found of gladness.
Cling to him, for he will guide you
Where no cross,
Pain or loss
Can again betide you.

Hasten, come, you heavy-hearted,
Who for sin
Deep within
Long and sore have smarted;
For the poisoned wounds you’re feeling,
Help is near;
One is here,
Mighty for his healing!

Blessèd Savior, let me find you!
Keeping me
Lovingly,
Cast me not behind you!
Life of life, my heart you’re stilling;
Calm I rest
On thy breast,
While this void you’re filling.
