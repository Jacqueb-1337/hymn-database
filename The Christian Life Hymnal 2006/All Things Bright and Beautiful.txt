All things bright and beautiful,
all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful,
the Lord God made them all.

Each little flow'r that opens,
each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colors,
He made their tiny wings

The purple-headed mountain,
the river running by,
the sunset and the morning
that brightens up the sky

The cold wind in the winter,
the pleasant summer sun,
the ripe fruits in the garden:
He made them every one

He gave us eyes to see them,
and lips that we might tell
how great is God Almighty,
who has made all things well
