At the Lamb's high feast we sing
praise to our victorious King,
who hath washed us in the tide
flowing from His pierc√©d side;
praise we Him whose love divine
gives His sacred blood for wine,
gives His body for the feast,
Christ the Victim, Christ the Priest.

Where the paschal blood is poured,
death's dark angel sheathes his sword;
Israel's hosts triumphant go
through the wave that drowns the foe.
Praise we Christ, whose blood was shed,
Paschal Victim, Paschal Bread;
with sincerity and love
eat we manna from above.

Mighty Victim from the sky,
pow'rs of hell beneath Thee lie;
death is conquered in the fight,
Thou hast brought us life and light;
hymns of glory and of praise,
risen Lord, to Thee we raise;
Holy Father, praise to Thee,
with the Spirit, ever be.
