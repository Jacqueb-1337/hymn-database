Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand;
The shadow of a mighty rock
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From burns beneath the noontide heat
And burdens of the day.

Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eyes at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffer'd there for me;
And from my striken heart, with tears,
Two wonders I confess:
The wonders of redeeming love,
And my unworthiness.

O safe and happy shelter!
O refuge tried and sweet!
O sacred place where Heaven's love
And Heaven's justice meet!
As to the exil'd patriarch
That wondrous dream was given,
So seems my Savior's cross to me:
A ladder up to Heav'n.

I take, O cross, your shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of his face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain or loss;
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross.
