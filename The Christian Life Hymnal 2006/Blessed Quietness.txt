Joys are flowing like a river
since the Comforter has come,
who abides with us forever,
makes the trusting heart a home.

Blessed quietness, holy quietness
what assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea speaking peace to me
how the billows cease to roll!

Like the rain that falls from heaven,
like the sunlight from the sky,
so the Holy Ghost is given,
coming on us from on high

See, a fruitful field is growing,
blessed fruit of righteousness,
and the streams of life are flowing
in the lonely wilderness

What a wonderful salvation,
where we always see Godâ€™s face!
What a perfect habitation,
what a quiet resting place!
