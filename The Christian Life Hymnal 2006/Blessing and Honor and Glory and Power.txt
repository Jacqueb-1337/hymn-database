Blessing and honor and glory and pow'r,
wisdom and riches and strength evermore
give ye to him who our battle hath won,
whose are the kingdom, the crown, and the throne.

Soundeth the heav'n of the heav'ns with his name;
ringeth the earth with his glory and fame;
ocean and mountain, stream, forest, and flow'r
echo his praises and tell of his pow'r.

Ever ascendeth the song and the joy;
ever descendeth the love from on high;
blessing and honor and glory and praise-â€”
this is the theme of the hymns that we raise.

Give we the glory and praise to the Lamb;
take we the robe and the harp and the palm;
sing we the song of the Lamb that was slain,
dying in weakness, but rising to reign.
