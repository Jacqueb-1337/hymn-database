Creator of the stars of night,
Your people's everlasting light,
Jesu, Redeemer, save us all,
And hear your servants when they call.

In sorrow at the helpless cry
Of all creation doomed to die,
Did save our lost and guilty race
By healing gifts of heav'nly grace.

When Earth was near its evening hour,
You did, in love’s redeeming pow’r,
Like bridegroom from his chamber, come
Forth from a virgin mother’s womb.

At your great name, exalted now,
All knees in lowly homage bow;
All things in Heav’n and Earth adore
And own you King forevermore.

To you, O Holy One, we pray,
Our Judge in that tremendous day,
Ward off, while yet we dwell below,
The weapons of our crafty foe.

To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, Three in One,
Praise, honor, might, and glory be,
From age to age eternally.
