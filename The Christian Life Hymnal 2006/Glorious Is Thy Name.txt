Bless√®d Saviour, we adore thee;
we thy love and grace proclaim.
Thou art mighty; thou are holy.
Glorious is thy matchless name!

Glorious, is thy name, O Lord!

Great Redeemer, Lord and Master,
light of all eternal days,
let the saints of every nation
sing thy just and endless praise! 

From the throne of heaven's glory
to the cross of sin and shame,
thou didst come to die a ransom,
guilty sinners to reclaim! 

Come, O come, immortal Saviour,
come and take thy royal throne.
Come, and reign, and reign forever;
be the kingdom all thine own!
