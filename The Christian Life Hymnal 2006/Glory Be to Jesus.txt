Glory be to Jesus,
who in bitter pains
poured for me the lifeblood
from his sacred veins.

Grace and life eternal
in that blood I find;
blest be his compassion,
infinitely kind.

Blest through endless ages
be the precious stream
which from endless torment
did the world redeem.

Abel's blood for vengeance
pleaded to the skies,
but the blood of Jesus
for our pardon cries.

Oft as earth exulting
lifts its praise on high,
angel hosts rejoicing
make their glad reply.

Lift we, then, our voices,
swell the mighty flood;
louder still and louder
praise the precious blood!
