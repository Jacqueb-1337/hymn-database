God the all-terrible! King, who ordainest
great winds thy clarions, lightnings thy sword,
show forth thy pity on high where thou reignest;
give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

God the omnipotent! Mighty avenger,
watching invisible, judging unheard,
save us in mercy, O save us from danger;
give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

God the all-merciful! Earth hath forsaken
thy ways of blessedness, slighted thy Word;
bid not thy wrath in its terrors awaken;
give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

God the all-righteous One! Man hath defied thee;
yet to eternity standeth thy Word;
falsehood and wrong shall not tarry beside thee;
give to us peace in our time, O Lord.

God the all-wise! By the fire of thy chast'ning,
earth shall to freedom and truth be restored;
through the thick darkness thy kingdom is hast'ning;
thou wilt give peace in thy time, O Lord.
