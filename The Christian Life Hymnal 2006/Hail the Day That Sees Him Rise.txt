Hail the day that sees him rise, Alleluia!
to his throne beyond the skiesAlleluia!
Christ, the Lamb for sinners given, Alleluia!
enters now the highest heavenAlleluia!

There for him high triumph waits; Alleluia!
lift your heads, eternal gatesAlleluia!
He has conquered death and sin; Alleluia!
take the King of glory inAlleluia!

Highest heaven its Lord receives; Alleluia!
yet he loves the earth he leavesAlleluia!
Though returning to his throne, Alleluia!
still he calls us all his ownAlleluia!

Still for us he intercedes; Alleluia!
his atoning death he pleads, Alleluia!
near himself prepares our place, Alleluia!
he the firstfruits of our raceAlleluia!

There we shall with you remain, Alleluia!
partners of your endless reign, Alleluia!
see you with unclouded view, Alleluia!
find our heaven of heavens in youAlleluia!
Psalter Hymnal, 1987
