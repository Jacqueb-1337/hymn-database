Hark, the glad sound! the Savior comes,
The Savior promised long!
Let ev'ry heart prepare a throne
And ev'ry voice a song.

He comes the pris'ners to release,
In Satan's bondage held;
The gates of brass before him burst,
The iron fetters yield.

He comes from thickest films of vice
To clear the mental ray,
And on the eyeballs of the blind
To pour celestial day.

He comes the broken heart to bind,
The bleeding soul to cure,
And with the treasures of his grace,
T’enrich the humble poor.

His silver trumpets publish loud
The Lord’s high jubilee;
Our debts are all remitted now,
Our heritage is free.

Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
Your welcome shall proclaim,
And Heav’n’s eternal arches ring
With your beloved name.
