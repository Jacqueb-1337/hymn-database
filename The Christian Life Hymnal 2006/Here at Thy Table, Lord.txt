Here at your table, Lord, this sacred hour,
Oh, let us feel you near in loving pow'r;
Calling our thoughts away from self and sin
As to your banquet hall we enter in.

Sit at the feast, dear Lord, break thou the bread;
Fill now the cup that brings life to the dead,
That we may find in you pardon and peace,
And from all bondage win a full release.

So shall our life of faith be full, be sweet,
And we shall find our strength for each day meet.
Fed by your living bread, all hunger past,
We shall be satisfied, and filled at last.

Come then, O holy Christ; feed us, we pray;
Touch with your pierced hand each common day,
Making this earthly life full of your grace,
Till at your side in love we find our place.
