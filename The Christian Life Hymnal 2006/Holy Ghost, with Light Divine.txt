Holy Spirit, light divine,
shine upon this heart of mine;
chase the gloom of night away,
turn the darkness into day.

Holy Spirit, love divine,
cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
in your mercy pity me,
from sin's bondage set me free.

Holy Spirit, joy divine,
cheer this saddened heart of mine;
fill me with your heav'nly peace,
let it grow and still increase.

Holy Spirit, pow'r divine,
dwell within this heart of mine;
cast down ev'ry idol throne,
reign supreme and reign alone.

Holy Spirit, fill my heart,
cleanse my life in ev'ry part;
your own temple I would be
now and for eternity.
