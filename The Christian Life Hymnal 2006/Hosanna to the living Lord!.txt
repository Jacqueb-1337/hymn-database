Hosanna to the living Lord!
Hosanna to th'incarnate Word!
To Christ, Creator, Savior, King,
let earth, let heav'n hosanna sing.

 "Hosanna, Lord!" your angels cry;
"Hosanna, Lord!" your saints reply.
Throughout the earth, around your throne,
your people sing in sweetest tone.

O Savior, with protecting care
abide in this your house of prayer,
Where we your parting promise claim,
assembled in your sacred name.

O Spirit, all our sins forgive,
and come within our hearts to live.
Our souls shall be your temple pure
and you will make our faith endure.

So, on that last and dreadful day,
when earth and heav'n shall melt away,
your flock, redeemed from sinful stain,
shall swell the sound of praise again.
