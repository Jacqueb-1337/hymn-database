I love thy kingdom, Lord,
the house of thine abode,
the church our blest Redeemer saved
with his own precious blood.

I love thy church, O God:
her walls before thee stand,
dear as the apple of thine eye
and graven on thy hand.

For her my tears shall fall,
for her my prayers ascend;
to her my cares and toils be giv'n,
'til toils and cares shall end.

Beyond my highest joy
I prize her heav'nly ways,
her sweet communion, solemn vows,
her hymns of love and praise.

Jesus, thou Friend divine,
our Savior and our King,
thy hand from ev'ry snare and foe
shall great deliv'rance bring.

Sure as thy truth shall last,
to Zion shall be giv'n
the brightest glories earth can yield,
and brighter bliss of heav'n.
