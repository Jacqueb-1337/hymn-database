Jesus is tenderly calling thee home-
Calling today, calling today;
Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam
Farther and farther away?

Calling today,
Calling today,
Jesus is calling,
Is tenderly calling today.

Jesus is calling the weary to rest-
Calling today, calling today;
Bring Him thy burden and thou shalt be blest-
He will not turn thee away

Jesus is waiting; O come to Him now-
Waiting today, waiting today;
Come with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow-
Come, and no longer delay

Jesus is pleading; O list to His voice-
Hear Him today, hear Him today;
They who believe on His name shall rejoice-
Quickly arise and away
