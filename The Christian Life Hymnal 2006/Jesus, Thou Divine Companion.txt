Jesus, our divine companion,
By your lowly human birth
You have come to join all workers,
Burden-bearers of the earth.
As the carpenter of Naz'reth,
Toiling for your daily food,
By your patience and your courage,
You have taught us work is good.

All who tread the path of labor
Follow where your feet have trod;
All who work without complaining
Do the holy will of God.
You, the peace surpassing knowledge,
Dwell with us in daily strife;
You, the Bread of heaven, broken
In the sacrament of life.

Ev'ry task, however simple,
Fills the soul with grace anew;
Ev'ry act of human kindness
Done in love is done to you.
Jesus, our divine companion,
Help us all to work our best;
Bless us in our daily labor,
Lead us to the Sabbath rest.
