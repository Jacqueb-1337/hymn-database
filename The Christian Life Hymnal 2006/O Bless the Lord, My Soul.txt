O bless the Lord, my soul!
His grace to thee proclaim!
And all that is within me join
To bless his holy name!

O bless the Lord, my soul!
His mercies bear in mind!
Forget not all his benefits!
The Lord to thee is kind.

He clothes us with his love;
Upholds us with his truth;
He heals all our infirmities
And ransoms us from death.

Then bless his holy name,
Whose grace hath made us whole,
Whose loving kindness crowns our days!
O bless the Lord, my soul!
