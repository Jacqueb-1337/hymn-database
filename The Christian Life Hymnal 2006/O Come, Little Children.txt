O come, little children, O come, one and all,
O come to the manger in Bethlehemâ€™s stall
And see what the Father in heaven so true
Has done to prepare a bright Christmas for you.

Behold, in the manger, that strange little bed,
A Child, sweet and gentle, is resting His head,
A Babe, clad in garments so pure and so white,
And fairer by far than the angels of light.

On hay and on straw in the manger He lies;
Both Mary and Joseph, with fond, loving eyes,
Are gazing upon Him, and shepherds draw near,
And jubilant angels from heaven appear.

O kneel with the shepherds in worshipful prayer
And join the dear angels who also are there;
Sing glory to God in the heavens above
And thank Him for Jesus, the gift of His love.

O dearest, O sweetest, O wonderful Child,
So pure and so holy, so good and so mild;
For us poor and weak in the manger hast lain,
For us like an innocent  lamb Thou wast slain.

Receive then our hearts, which we offer to Thee,
And keep them from sin and from wickedness free;
O render them holy and blessed like Thine,
Thou Son of the Highest, Thou Infant divine.
