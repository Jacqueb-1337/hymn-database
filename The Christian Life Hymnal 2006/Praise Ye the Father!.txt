Praise ye the Father for His lovingkindness,
tenderly caring for His erring children;
praise Him, ye angels; praise Him in the heavens;
praise to the Father!

Praise ye the Savior for His deep compassion,
graciously caring for His chosen people;
young men and maidens, ye old men and children,
praise to the Savior!

Praise ye the Spirit, Comforter of Israel,
sent from the Father and the Son to bless us;
praise to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit!
Praise to the triune God!
