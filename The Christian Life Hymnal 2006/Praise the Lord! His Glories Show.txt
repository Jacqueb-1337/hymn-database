Praise the Lord! God’s glories show, Alleluia!
saints within God's courts below, Alleluia!
angels round the throne above, Alleluia!
all who see and share God's loveAlleluia!

Earth to heaven exalt the strain,  Alleluia!
Send it, heaven, to earth again, Alleluia!
Age to age, God’s mercies trace, Alleluia!
Praise God’s providence and grace! Alleluia!

Strings and voices, hands and hearts, Alleluia!
in the concert, bear your parts, Alleluia!
All that breathes, your Lord adore, Alleluia!
singing praise forevermore, Alleluia!
