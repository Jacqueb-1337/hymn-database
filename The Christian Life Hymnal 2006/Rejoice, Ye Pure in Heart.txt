Rejoice, O pure in heart,
rejoice, give thanks, and sing;
your festal banner wave on high,
the cross of Christ your King.

Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice, give thanks, and sing!

Bright youth and snow-crowned age,
both men and women, raise
on high your free, exulting song,
declare God's wondrous praise

Still lift your standard high,
still chanting as you go,
from youth to age, by night and day,
in gladness and in woe

At last the march shall end;
the wearied ones shall rest,
the pilgrims reach their home at last,
Jerusalem the blest

Praise God, who reigns on high,
the Lord whom we adore:
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
one God forevermore
Psalter Hymnal, 1987
