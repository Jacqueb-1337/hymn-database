See, the conq'ror mounts in triumph,
See the King in royal state,
Riding on the clouds, his chariot,
To his heav'nly palace gate;
Hark, the choirs of angel voices
Joyful hallelujahs sing,
And the portals high and lifted
To receive their heav'nly King.

Who is this who comes in glory,
With the trump of jubilee?
Lord of battles, God of armies,
He has gained the victory;
He who on the cross did suffer,
He who from the grave arose,
He has vanquished sin and Satan,
He by death has spoiled his foes.

While he raised his hands in blessing,
He was parted from his friends;
While his eager eyes behold him,
He upon the clouds ascends;
He who walked with God and pleased him,
Preaching truth and doom to come,
Christ, our Enoch, is translated
To his everlasting home.

Raise us from the Earth to Heaven,
Give us wings of faith and love,
Gales of holy aspirations
Wafting us to realms above;
That with hearts and minds uplifted,
We with Christ our Lord may dwell,
Where he sits enthroned in glory,
In his heav'nly citadel.
