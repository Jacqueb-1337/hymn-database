Shepherd of souls, refresh and bless
Your chosen pilgrim flock
With manna in the wilderness,
With water from the rock.

We would not live by bread alone,
But by your word of grace,
In strength of which we travel on
To our abiding place.

Be known to us in breaking bread,
But do not then depart;
Savior, abide with us, and spread
Your table in our heart.

Lord, sup with us in love divine;
Your body and your blood,
That living bread, that heav'nly wine,
Be our immortal food.
