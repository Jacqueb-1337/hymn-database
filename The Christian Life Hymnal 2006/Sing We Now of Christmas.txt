Sing we now of Christmas,
Noel, sing we here!
Hear our grateful praises
to the babe so dear.

Sing we Noel, the King is born, Noel!
Sing we now of Christmas, sing we now Noel!

Angels called to shepherds,
"Leave your flocks at rest,
journey forth to Bethlehem,
find the lambkin blest." 

In Bethlehem they found him;
Joseph and Mary mild,
seated by the manger,
watching the holy child

From the eastern country
came the kings afar,
bearing gifts to Bethlehem
guided by a star

Gold and myrrh they took there,
gifts of greatest price;
there was ne'er a place on earth
so like paradise
