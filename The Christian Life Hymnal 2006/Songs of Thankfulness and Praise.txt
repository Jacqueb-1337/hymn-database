Songs of thankfulness and praise,
Jesus, Lord, to you we raise,
manifested by the star
to the Magi from afar,
branch of royal David's stem,
in your birth at Bethlehem.
Anthems be to you addressed,
God in man made manifest.

Manifest at Jordan's stream,
Prophet, Priest, and King supreme,
and at Cana, wedding guest,
in your Godhead manifest;
manifest in pow'r divine,
changing water into wine.
Anthems be to you addressed,
God in man made manifest.

Manifest in making whole
palsied limbs and fainting soul;
manifest in valiant fight,
quelling all the devil's might;
manifest in gracious will,
ever bringing good from ill:
Anthems be to you addressed,
God in man made manifest.

Sun and moon shall darkened be,
stars shall fall, the heav'ns shall flee.
Christ will then like lightning shine;
all will see his glorious sign.
All will then the trumpet hear,
all will see the judge appear.
You by all will be confessed,
God in man made manifest.

Grant us grace to see you, Lord,
mirrored in your holy Word.
May our lives and all we do
imitate and honor you
that we all like you may be
at your great epiphany
and may praise you, ever blest,
God in man made manifest.
