Stand up and bless the Lord,
ye people of His choice;
stand up and bless the Lord your God
with heart and soul and voice.

Though high above all praise,
above all blessing high,
who would not fear His holy name
and laud and magnify?

O for the living flame
from His own altar brought,
to touch our lips, our minds inspire,
and wing to heav'n our thought!

There, with benign regard,
our hymns He deigns to hear;
tho' unrevealed to mortal sense,
the spirit feels Him near.

God is our strength and song,
and His salvation ours;
then be His love in Christ proclaimed
with all our ransomed pow'rs.

Stand up and bless the Lord;
the Lord your God adore;
stand up and bless His glorious name
henceforth and evermore.
