I know of a name,
A beautiful name,
That angels bro't down to earth;
They whispered it low
One night long ago,
To a maiden of lowly birth.

That beautiful name,
That beautiful name,
From sin has power to free us!
That beautiful name,
That wonderful name,
That matchless name is Jesus!

I know of a name,
A beautiful name,
That unto a Babe was given;
The stars glittered bright
Thro'out that glad night,
And angels praised God in heav’n

The One of that name,
My Savior became,
My Savior of Calvary;
My sins nailed Him there,
My burdens He bare.
He suffered all this for me

I love that blest name,
That wonderful name,
Made higher than all in heaven;
’Twas whispered, I know,
In my heart long ago,
To Jesus my life I’ve given
