In the little village of Bethlehem,
There lay a Child one day,
And the sky was bright with a holy light
O'er the place where Jesus lay.

Alleluia!  O how the angels sang.
Alleluia!  How it rang!
And the sky was bright with a holy light,
'Twas the birthday of a King.

  'Twas a humble birth-place, but O how much
God gave to us that day,
From the manger bed what a path has led,
What a perfect, holy way
Baptist Hymnal, 1991
