Begin, my soul, some heavenly theme,
awake, my voice, and sing
the mighty works, or mightier name,
Of our eternal King.

Tell of his wondrous faithfulness,
And sound his power abroad;
sing the sweet promise of his grace,
the quickening word of God.

Engraved as in eternal brass,
the mighty promise shines;
nor can the powers of darkness rase
those everlasting lines.

His every word of grace is strong,
as that which built the skies;
the voice that rolls the stars along
speaks all the promises.

Now shall my fainting heart rejoice
to know thy favour sure:
I trust the all-creating voice,
and faith desires no more.
