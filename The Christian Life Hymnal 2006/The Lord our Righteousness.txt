Jesus, thy blood and righteousness,
My beauty are, my glorious dress;
Midst flaming worlds, in these arrayed,
With joy shall I lift up my head.

The holy, meek, unspotted Lamb,
Who from the Father's bosom came,
Who died for me, e'en me t' atone,
Now for my Lord and God I own.

Lord, I believe thy precious blood,
Which at the mercy seat of God,
Forever doth for sinners plead,
For me, e'en for my soul was shed.

When from the dust of death I rise
To claim my mansion in the skies,
E’en then this shall be all my plea,
Jesus hath lived, hath died for me.

Jesus, be endless praise to thee,
Whose boundless mercy hath for me
And all who trust thy hands hath made
An everlasting ransom paid.

Ah! give to all, almighty Lord,
With pow’r to speak thy gracious word,
That all who to thy wounds will flee
May find eternal life in thee.

Oh, let the dead now hear thy voice!
Now bid thy banished ones rejoice;
Their beauty this, their glorious dress,
Jesus, thy blood and righteousness.
