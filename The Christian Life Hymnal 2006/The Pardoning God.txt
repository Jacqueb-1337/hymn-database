Great God of wonders, all thy ways
are matchless, God-like and divine;
but the fair glories of thy grace
more God-like and unrivaled shine:

Who is a pardoning God like thee,
or who has grace so rich and free?

Such dire offences to forgive,
such guilty rebel souls to spare;
this is thy grand prerogative,
and none shall in the honour share: 

In wonder lost, with trembling joy,
we take the pardon of our God,
pardon for sins of deepest dye,
a pardon sealed with Jesus' blood: 

O may this glorious matchless love,
this God-like miracle of grace,
teach mortal tongues, like those above,
to raise this song of lofty praise:
