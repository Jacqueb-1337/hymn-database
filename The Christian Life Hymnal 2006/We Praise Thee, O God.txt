We praise you, O God, our Redeemer, Creator;
in grateful devotion our tribute we bring;
we lay it before you; we kneel and adore you;
we bless your holy name: glad praises we sing.

We worship you, God of our fathers and mothers;
through life's storm and tempest our guide you have been;
when perils o'ertake us, you never forsake us,
and with your help, O Lord, our battles we win.

With voices united our praises we offer,
our songs of thanksgiving to you we now raise;
your strong arm will guide us, our God is beside us,
to you, our great Redeemer, forever be praise!
Worship and Rejoice
