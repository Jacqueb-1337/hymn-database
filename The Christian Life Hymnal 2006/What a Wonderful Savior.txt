Christ has for sin atonement made–
What a wonderful Savior!
We are redeemed, the price is paid–
What a wonderful Savior!

What a wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Jesus!
What a wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Lord!

I praise Him for the cleansing blood–
What a wonderful Savior!
That reconciled my soul to God–
What a wonderful Savior! 

He cleansed my heart from all its sin–
What a wonderful Savior!
And now He reigns and rules therein–
What a wonderful Savior! 

He gives me overcoming pow'r–
What a wonderful Savior!
And triumph in each trying hour–
What a wonderful Savior!
