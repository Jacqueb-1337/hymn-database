While by the sheep we watched at night,
glad tidings brought an angel bright.

How great our joy!
Great our joy!
Joy, joy, joy!
Joy, joy, joy!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!

There shall be born, so he did say,
in Bethlehem a child today

There shall the child lie in a stall,
this child who shall redeem us all

This gift of God we'll cherish well,
that ever joy our hearts shall fill
