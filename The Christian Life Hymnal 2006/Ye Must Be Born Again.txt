A ruler once harkened to Jesus by night
To ask him the way of salvation and light;
The master made answer in words true and plain:
You must be born again.

You must be born again,
You must be born again,
I verily, verily say unto you,
You must be born again.

O children of frailty, attend to the word
So solemnly uttered by Jesus, the Lord,
And let not this message to you be in vain:
You must be born again

O ye who would enter that glorious rest,
And sing with the ransomed the song of the blest,
The life everlasting if you would obtain,
You must be born again
A dear one departed your heart yearns to see,
At Heaven's brite gate may be watching for thee,
So list to the note of this solemn refrain:
You must be born again
